/**
 * SSRF-defence URL validator. Server-side handlers that fetch a
 * user-supplied URL (an outbound webhook, a link-preview, an avatar import)
 * are a server-side request forgery target: an attacker submits a URL
 * pointing at the cloud instance-metadata endpoint (`169.254.169.254`), a
 * loopback admin panel, or an RFC1918 service, and the server fetches it
 * from inside the trust boundary. `isSafeUrl` answers "is it safe to fetch
 * this URL" with a single boolean.
 *
 * Pure logic, no `node:dns` import: the synchronous `isSafeUrl` / `checkUrl`
 * classify the literal host (numeric IPs in any encoding are normalised and
 * range-checked; DNS names are classified on their literal text only). The
 * async `checkUrlResolved` takes a caller-supplied resolver to close the
 * DNS-rebinding gap.
 *
 * Blocked: loopback (`127.0.0.0/8`, `::1`, `localhost`), link-local IPv4
 * (`169.254.0.0/16`), cloud metadata (`169.254.169.254`, `fd00:ec2::254`,
 * `metadata.google.internal` and bare `metadata`), RFC1918 (`10/8`,
 * `172.16/12`, `192.168/16`), RFC 6598 CGNAT shared space (`100.64.0.0/10`,
 * incl. Alibaba Cloud's `100.100.100.200` metadata), IETF protocol assignments
 * (`192.0.0.0/24`), benchmark (`198.18.0.0/15`), multicast (`224.0.0.0/4`),
 * reserved (`240.0.0.0/4`), unspecified (`0.0.0.0/8`, `::`), IPv6 ULA
 * (`fc00::/7`) and site-local (`fec0::/10`), IPv6 link-local (`fe80::/10`),
 * IPv6 multicast (`ff00::/8`), and IPv4-mapped / compatible / translated IPv6
 * forms (unwrapped to the embedded IPv4).
 *
 * The IPv4-embedding transition mechanisms are covered the same way: NAT64
 * across the whole of `64:ff9b::/32` (the span holding the well-known
 * `64:ff9b::/96` from RFC 6052 and the local-use `64:ff9b:1::/48` from RFC
 * 8215, read at all six prefix lengths RFC 6052 defines, since the address text
 * does not record which one produced it - covering the whole `/32` is a
 * fail-closed choice over unassigned space, not a spec requirement, because the
 * RFC permits the well-known prefix only at `/96`), 6to4 (`2002::/16`), and
 * ISATAP (RFC 5214,
 * recognised by its `0000:5efe` / `0200:5efe` interface identifier under any
 * unicast prefix) unwrap to the embedded IPv4 and re-check, while Teredo
 * (`2001::/32`) is blocked outright as `reserved`.
 *
 * Non-http(s) schemes are rejected in every mode. IP-obfuscation evasions
 * (decimal / octal / hex / short-form IPv4, IPv4-mapped IPv6, userinfo
 * smuggling, trailing-dot, case) are normalised before matching.
 *
 * This is the single canonical copy: `svelte-adapter-ws-extensions/safe-url`
 * re-exports it and `svelte-realtime` imports it directly.

	 * and only relevant on a NAT64 network. For a Network-Specific Prefix outside
	 * `64:ff9b::/32`, it is REQUIRED for this guard to recognise that the
	 * ordinary-looking IPv6 range carries IPv4.
	 *
	 * Without it the prefix length cannot be recovered from an address, so the
	 * embedded IPv4 is read at all six RFC 6052 lengths and the address is
	 * refused if any reading is private. That is fail-closed but not free: the
	 * readings that do not match the real prefix decode prefix bits and padding
	 * into a phantom IPv4, which lands in a blocked range for roughly a quarter
	 * of public destinations at `/48` and a third at `/32` and `/40`. For a
	 * `/96` sourced from `64:ff9b:1::/48` the subnet id becomes the phantom's
	 * leading octets, so about a quarter of subnet ids refuse every public
	 * destination.
	 *
	 * Declaring the exact prefix takes one reading, which removes both the
	 * over-block and the `0.0.0.0/8` residual. A private embedded address is still
	 * refused.
	 *
	 * DECLARE THE EXACT PREFIX YOUR TRANSLATOR USES. This option is a TRUSTED
	 * ASSERTION about the network. A parseable wrong length in EITHER direction
	 * can turn an address the guard would otherwise refuse into an allowed one: a
	 * shorter declaration reads prefix bits as the destination, while a longer
	 * declaration reads destination and suffix bits. The real length is not
	 * recoverable from the address text, and trying every length would restore the
	 * over-block this option exists to remove. A non-zero suffix proves some
	 * mismatches and is refused, but a clean suffix does not prove the declaration
	 * correct. Only an UNPARSEABLE value is safe by default - that one is ignored
	 * and every length is read.
	 *
	 * At `/96`, RFC 6052 also requires bits 64-71 of the prefix itself to be
	 * zero; a `/96` declaration that violates it refuses every destination in
	 * the range rather than none.
	 *
	 * @example
	 * isSafeUrl(url, { nat64Prefix: '64:ff9b::/96' });
