// Pure decision helpers for the worker-supervision protocol, factored out of the
// is_primary / worker branches of index.js so they are drivable in a unit test
// without spawning worker threads (index.js spawns real ones) and so the
// deterministic cluster sim judges liveness through the SAME decisions it ships -
// one source of truth, no parallel model to drift. Three functions:
//   - classifyWorkerHealth: the primary's per-worker escalate/keep verdict.
//   - resolveBootTimeout:   clamps the WORKER_BOOT_TIMEOUT_MS knob to a safe floor.
//   - routeWorkerMessage:   the worker's boot-time inbound-control-message gate.
//
// Two regimes, flipped at the ready/descriptor moment (NOT at the first heartbeat
// ack):
//
//   - steady-state: a worker that has confirmed ready but then went silent past
//     the steady timeout is wedged (deadlock / infinite loop). lastHeartbeat is
//     always > 0 once a worker has reported ready.
//
//   - boot: a worker still running its `init` hook. A healthy async init answers
//     the primary's heartbeats (its pre-start liveness responder is live before
//     `await start()`), so its clock keeps advancing and it is NEVER boot-killed
//     however slow it is; an init that wedges the event loop (a sync loop / native
//     hang) never acks, so its clock - lastHeartbeat once it has acked at least
//     once, else spawnedAt - goes stale past the (separate, generous) boot deadline
//     and the slot is escalated. The boot deadline is kept distinct from the steady
//     timeout so a slow-but-healthy warmup whose sync stretches exceed the tight
//     steady timeout is not false-killed; `bootTimeoutMs <= 0` disables it (a wedged
//     boot then stays stranded, the pre-fix behavior).
