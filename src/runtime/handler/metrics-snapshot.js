// Cluster-wide metrics collection: the worker side of the snapshot round trip.
//
// Each worker thread holds its own registry, and every worker serves the same
// port, so an ordinary scrape route reads whichever worker took the request.
// This asks the primary to collect every live worker's mirrored values and
// merges them under the signal manifest's per-metric aggregation law.
//
// What crosses the boundary is the values the adapter itself wrote (the mirror
// in utils/metrics.js), never a registry's rendered exposition text - see the
// header of utils/metrics-merge.js for why that distinction is the whole
// design. It also means `serialize()` is NOT required for this to work: a
// registry that cannot render text still gets a correct cluster snapshot.
//
// Single-process deployments take the same path minus the round trip, so the
// document an operator scrapes has the same shape whether or not clustering is
// on - turning CLUSTER_WORKERS on does not change the dashboard.
