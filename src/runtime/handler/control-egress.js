// The one way a server-generated frame reaches a client OUTSIDE a publish.
//
// Everything sent here shares a property that ordinary fan-out does not have:
// the client asked for it. A subscribe buys an ack, a bad frame buys a refusal,
// an oversized batch buys a denial per topic past the cap. That makes the whole
// channel an AMPLIFIER - a few inbound bytes name a topic and are answered with
// a whole frame - so it is bounded per connection, in bytes over time, and a
// connection that blows the bound is cut rather than served.
//
// MEASURED, on this runtime, at the worst legal shape: one 8,121-byte
// `subscribe-batch` carrying 1,344 shortest-legal topics is answered with
// 97,484 bytes across 1,345 frames. Twelve times what it cost to ask, and
// repeatable - the frame is legal, so nothing refuses the next one.
//
// WHY THE EXISTING DEFENCES MISS IT. The control-frame limit (wire.js,
// 8 KiB) bounds one frame, which bounds the frame COUNT per inbound frame but
// not the rate. Inbound message admission would bound the rate, but every one
// of its limits is zero-by-default, so out of the box there is none. The
// publish-egress ceilings bound application publishes and never see an ack.
// And `maxBackpressure` bounds the queue in MEMORY, which is why this is a CPU
// and bandwidth problem rather than an out-of-memory one.
//
// WHY NOT SHED INSTEAD OF CUT. An ack the client never receives is a
// subscription it believes did not take - the exact failure the loud per-topic
// denial exists to prevent. Dropping acks silently would trade an amplifier for
// a correctness bug, so a connection over its budget is told and closed.
