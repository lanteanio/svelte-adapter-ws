// Server-wide wire-id table for shared binary fan-out. A stateless codec marked
// `shared: true` (the mega-lobby world-snapshot tier) is fanned out via cohort uWS
// topics so one publish is two native app.publish calls instead of a per-connection
// walk - which only works if every binary subscriber's 0x03 frame is BYTE-IDENTICAL.
// The only per-connection-varying byte in a stateless frame is the topic-id varint,
// so a shared topic gets ONE id server-wide here, announced to each binary client on
// its cohort subscribe.
//
// Id-space partition: the per-connection allocator (wire.js allocWireId) hands out
// ids 1, 2, 3... and NEVER reclaims them - the counter is monotonic, one id per
// distinct topic a connection has ever been sent a binary frame for. A connection
// that is on both ordinary (per-connection-id) topics and shared (global-id) topics
// keeps ONE id -> topic map, so the two id spaces MUST stay disjoint or the client
// resolves the wrong topic. Global ids therefore start at SHARED_WIRE_ID_BASE = 2^32:
// for a per-connection counter to reach that it would need 2^32 live `byName` Map
// entries (~hundreds of GB), exhausting the worker heap long before - so a
// per-connection id can never reach a shared one. (The varint encodes the full value
// with division/multiplication, so a 5-byte id round-trips exactly; the few extra
// header bytes are paid only by the shared tier, against a large snapshot payload.)
// A reclaim-on-unsubscribe free-list for the per-connection allocator would bound the
// counter to the concurrent-subscription cap and make the partition provable rather
// than heap-bounded; it touches the hot per-connection wire path and is deferred.

// First global id. Far above any per-connection id could reach before the worker
// heap is exhausted (the per-connection allocator is monotonic + unreclaimed); also
// well above MAX_SUBSCRIPTIONS_PER_CONNECTION, the concurrent-subscription cap.
