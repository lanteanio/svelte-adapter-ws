/**
 * Resolve (allocating on first use) the per-connection binary topic-id for a
 * topic. On a fresh assignment, announce the `name -> id` mapping to the
 * client in a `{type:'wire-id'}` control frame so an inbound `0x03` frame's
 * numeric id resolves back to the topic name. The announce rides the same
 * socket immediately before the first binary frame for the topic, so ordering
 * guarantees the client records the mapping first - no ack/frame race.
 * Per-connection and reset on reconnect (a reconnect is a new connection with
 * fresh userData).
 *
 * Returns -1 when the announce frame itself was dropped by backpressure
 * (ws.send returned 2): the client never learns the mapping, and the mapping
 * is never re-announced, so every later binary frame for this topic would be
 * undecodable on this connection. Callers must send the JSON envelope for the
 * current frame and poison the capability (see poisonWireState). A send
 * result of 0 (enqueued behind backpressure) still delivers in order and is
 * success here; only 2 is a drop.

 * dropped frame leaves the client decoder desynced forever: later refs to a
 * never-announced key decode to null (the entity freezes on that connection)
 * and later delta stamps skew. JSON is the recovery tier because dictionary
 * state cannot be resynchronized in-band; the shared envelope carries full
 * keys and absolute values, so the connection stays correct, just
 * unoptimized. Reconnect restores binary: a reconnect is a new connection
 * with fresh userData, a fresh dictionary, and a fresh announce.
 *
 * Disposes the codec's state via its onDetach (exactly once - the sentinel
