// Live-frame buffering for the replay-to-live cutover. When a connection
// gap-fills a topic on subscribe (a recover offset), the server reads the
// backend, then subscribes the client to live. Between those two steps an ASYNC
// resume hook yields the event loop, so a publish landing in that window is past
// the backend read but not yet on the live membership - the client would never
// see it, a silent gap. The barrier here holds those live frames: a buffer is
// opened BEFORE the resume await, every fan-out site appends to it during the
// window, and once live membership is installed the held frames are flushed in
// order (deduped against what the resume already covered) before the ack.
//
// A synchronous (in-memory) resume never yields a macrotask, so nothing is
// captured and the flush is a no-op - identical to the pre-barrier behavior. The
// window only ever holds frames behind a network-backed resume.
