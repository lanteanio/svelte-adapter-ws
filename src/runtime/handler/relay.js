/**
 * Per-topic outbound relay streams: what this worker has handed to the relay.
 *
 * `ord` counts the frames sent for a topic and `birth` is when the first one was
 * sent. Together with this worker's thread id they ride each relayed frame so a
 * RECEIVER can check the stream for holes - the frames it should have received
 * from us, numbered densely, plus the instant the stream began so it can tell
 * "I lost the prefix" from "this was already running before I attached".
 *
 * Why a separate counter rather than reusing the publish seq: the seq is not
 * dense over THIS path. A topic also published locally-only (`{ relay: false }`,
 * or the game lane) advances the seq without sending anything, so a receiver
 * would see a jump and cry wolf; an explicit `{ seq: n }` authority interleaves
 * values from several workers, so per-origin contiguity is meaningless; and a
 * `{ seq: false }` topic has no number at all. This counter has exactly one
 * meaning - frames we relayed for this topic - so a hole in it is a lost frame
 * and never anything else.
 *
 * One entry per relayed topic, and `birth` is read once when the entry is
 * created, so the steady-state cost is a single map lookup per relayed publish.

 * and arrive first, which reads to the receiver as a hole that never fills.
