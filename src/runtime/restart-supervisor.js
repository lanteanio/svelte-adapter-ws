/**
 * Per-slot crash-restart supervisor for the cluster primary.
 *
 * A cluster owns a FIXED set of worker slots - `io_count` io slots plus
 * `compute_count` compute slots. Each slot has a stable identity (`role#index`)
 * that survives a crash: a dead worker's replacement re-occupies the SAME slot
 * with the same replayed workerData. This supervisor tracks the restart attempt
 * count, the exponential backoff delay, and the pending respawn timer PER SLOT.
 *
 * The point of per-slot state is isolation. When these three lived as single
 * cohort-global variables, any worker reaching "ready" reset the shared backoff
 * and cleared EVERY pending restart timer - so a simultaneous two-worker flap
 * let the first slot's recovery cancel the second slot's still-pending respawn,
 * and capacity stayed permanently reduced. With per-slot budgets a slot only
 * ever resets or reschedules itself, and `reconcile()` reschedules any slot left
 * with no live worker, no booting worker, and no pending respawn - a safety net
 * for the live-plus-spawning-plus-pending-equals-desired invariant. (A slot that
 * is merely booting, `spawning`, is intentionally left alone; a worker that
 * WEDGES mid-boot - never reports and so stays `spawning` forever - is out of
 * this module's reach and is the primary's boot-deadline watchdog's job.)
 *
 * A worker reporting ready no longer resets its slot's budget on its own. A
 * crash-looping slot that reports a brief `ready` between every crash would
 * otherwise reset its attempt count on every recovery and so never exhaust - it
 * would flap forever, invisible to the exhaustion escalation. Instead the budget
 * resets on the NEXT exit, and only when the slot had been stably up for at
 * least `stableMs`: a genuinely healthy worker that finally dies gets a fresh
 * backoff, while a fast flapper (up for less than `stableMs` between crashes)
 * keeps accumulating attempts until it exhausts. `noteReady` just records when
 * the worker came up; `noteExit` reads that timestamp to decide.
 *
 * All timing is injected (`setTimer`/`clearTimer`/`now`) so the scheduling logic
 * is unit-testable without real timers or real worker threads. Cold path: this
 * only runs when a worker actually exits.
 *
 * @param {object} opts
