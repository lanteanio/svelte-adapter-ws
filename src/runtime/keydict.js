/**
 * Per-connection short-id key dictionaries and the delta-coded stamp helpers
 * shared by the binary topic codecs.
 *
 * A dictionaried wire replaces repeated key strings with small per-connection
 * integer ids: the first time a key appears on a connection it is announced
 * inline (the key string travels once); after that a frame carries a 1-2 byte
 * id and the decoder resolves it from a cached id->key map. The keyref is a
 * single varint `v`:
 *
 *   - `v == 0` KEY-ASSIGN: followed by `varint(id)` then the key string.
 *     Binds `id -> key` for this connection, then this occurrence uses `id`.
 *   - `v == 1` INLINE: followed by the key string, with no id binding. The
 *     overflow fallback when the id space is exhausted within a single frame.
 *   - `v >= 2` REF: the id is `v - 2` (0 and 1 are reserved for the escapes
 *     above). No key bytes on the wire.
 *
 * Eviction: ids live in a bounded space (`maxEntries`, default 65536). The
 * dict grows until the cap, then a new key reclaims the least-recently-used
 * entry whose last use predates the current frame (so an id assigned earlier
 * in the same frame is never reused by a later entry in that frame) and takes
 * its id; the decoder re-syncs from the KEY-ASSIGN that carries the reused
 * id. A key that still cannot get an id (a single frame referencing more than
 * `maxEntries` distinct keys) falls back to a full-string INLINE keyref.
 * There is no free-on-remove: a removal leaves the id bound, so a
 * re-appearing key reuses it with no new assign, and LRU reclaims genuinely
 * departed ids at the cap. State is per-connection and discarded when the
 * connection closes; both sides reset on reconnect.
 *
 * The delta-stamp helpers carry a server wall-clock stamp at one byte
 * steady-state: the first stamp a fresh dictionary writes is the absolute
 * epoch-ms value; every later one is the non-negative delta against the
 * dictionary's `lastT` (a backward wall step writes 0 and holds, so both
 * sides stay non-decreasing and in lock-step). The stamp state lives on the
 * dictionaries with the same in-order, reset-on-reconnect,
 * untouched-on-JSON-fallback discipline as the key map - a codec must fully
 * validate a frame BEFORE writing its stamp, so a frame that falls back to
 * JSON leaves both sides' state unchanged.
 *
 * Pure: no clocks, no timers, no imports. Time enters only through the
 * injected `timeSource` a consuming codec binds, so the module bundles for
 * the browser and runs under a deterministic harness unchanged.
 *
