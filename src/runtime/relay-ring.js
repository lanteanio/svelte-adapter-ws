// @ts-check
// SPSC shared-memory byte ring for the cross-worker relay hot path.
//
// The cluster relay is a star through the primary: a publishing worker hands
// its per-microtask batch to the primary, and the primary re-sends every
// message to every other worker. Over `postMessage` each hop structured-clones
// the message - the primary pays one clone per message per receiving worker,
// so a hot topic on an N-worker box costs O(N) clones per publish plus the
// per-message queue machinery.
//
// This module replaces that hop with one SharedArrayBuffer ring per direction
// per worker (worker -> primary, primary -> worker). Each ring is a
// single-producer / single-consumer BYTE STREAM: the producer appends framed
// bytes, the consumer drains them, and `Atomics.waitAsync` wakes each side
// with no polling. Byte-stream semantics (not slot semantics) are what make
// the hard cases fall out for free:
//
//   - ORDER: one stream per direction, so relay order is exactly preserved -
//     there is never a second path a frame can race ahead on.
//   - BACKPRESSURE: a full ring spills into the producer's pending queue and
//     flushes as the consumer frees space (the consumer's readPos advance IS
//     the wake-up signal), minus postMessage's per-message allocation. That
//     spill is BOUNDED when a writer is given ceilings: a peer whose BACKLOG
//     passes the byte ceiling, or which stops draining for longer than the age
//     ceiling, is quarantined. Both ceilings describe the peer's own failure to
//     keep up - never the size of what it is being handed - and both are
//     decided before any byte is committed, so a refusal never leaves a partial
//     frame in the stream.
//   - OVERSIZED FRAMES: a frame larger than the ring streams through in
//     pieces; the reader's accumulator reassembles it. No fallback path, no
//     reordering window. A large frame is therefore not a peer fault and does
//     not quarantine anyone; bounding what a single frame may cost is the
//     SENDER's job, above this module.
//
// The relay envelope is JSON-serializable by construction (the envelope field
// IS a pre-serialized JSON string), so a message is encoded to bytes ONCE by
// the publisher; the primary forwards the framed bytes VERBATIM (memcpy, zero
// parse, zero clone) and only the receiving worker decodes.
//
// The wire format is process-internal (both ends are always the same build in
// the same process), so it carries no version negotiation.
