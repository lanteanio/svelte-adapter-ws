 * recognise and the subscription silently delivers nothing. On the
 * server-named `platform.subscribe` lane the name is built by app code (a
 * slice landing mid-pair), and there the client never sees anything but the
 * replaced form, so it holds no name it could send back to clear the
 * subscription again.
