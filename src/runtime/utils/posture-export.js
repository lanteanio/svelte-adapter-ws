/**
 * Posture push-export: a local stream socket where an external process can
 * follow the adapter's live protection posture.
 *
 * An edge-defense daemon (an L3/L4 filter, a front proxy, a watchdog) wants
 * one thing from the app it protects: "how loaded are you, right now?" -
 * without speaking the app's protocol or scraping metrics over HTTP. This
 * module listens on a unix domain socket (or a Windows named pipe) and
 * pushes newline-delimited JSON:
 *
 *   {"v":1,"posture":"elevated","reason":"PSI","value":0.83,"psi":{...},"cpuThrottle":{...}}
 *
 * A line is pushed to every connected client immediately on connect, on
 * every posture/reason transition, and on every 1 Hz pressure sample. The
 * steady 1 Hz cadence is part of the contract: a consumer that stops
 * receiving lines knows the adapter is gone (killed, frozen, deadlocked)
 * without any extra liveness protocol.
 *
 * Local-only by design: a filesystem socket inherits filesystem
 * permissions, exposes nothing over the network, and carries no client
 * identity or payload data - posture, reason, and kernel pressure numbers
 * only. Consumers are read-only; inbound bytes are ignored.
 *
 * Failure philosophy: the export must never hurt the server it reports on.
 * Listen errors log once and disable the export; a slow or dead consumer
 * with backed-up buffers is disconnected rather than buffered without
 * bound; serialization happens once per push regardless of client count
 * and not at all with zero clients.
 *
