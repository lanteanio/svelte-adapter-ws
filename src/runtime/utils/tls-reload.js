// place (handler/tls.js `reloadTls` is the worker half; a single-process
// server arms its own watch there instead). The primary terminates no TLS -
// reuseport workers own their listen sockets outright - so its whole job is
// the broadcast plus an observability record of the disk cert's identity and
// expiry.
//
// Pure/injectable by construction: parseSniHosts, readCertIdentity,
// certExpiryAlert and applyServerNames are pure over their inputs, and
// createTlsDegradedLedger is pure over the callbacks it is handed, so the
// clear-what-a-success-can-clear policy is executable without a server, a
// watcher or a certificate. createCertWatcher takes its
// clock (setTimer/clearTimer) and fs (watchFs) as injected dependencies,
// defaulting to the runtime seam so the debounce stays deterministic under a
// seeded harness (check-determinism).
