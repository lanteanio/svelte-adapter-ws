// - Bounded-by-default capacity caps ---------------------------------------
// Single source of truth for the per-connection and module-level Map / Set
// caps that handler.js, vite.js, and testing.js all enforce. The numbers
// are deliberately generous - far above any healthy single-connection use,
// even at uWS's million-connection scale - so they catch obvious bugs
// (subscribe-in-a-loop, request-without-await, coalesce-key-leak) without
// ever biting real apps. Aggregate memory is bounded separately by
// `upgradeAdmission.maxConnections`; per-conn caps are not the right place
// to defend against a 1M-connection DoS.
