// Symbol-keyed slots for adapter-internal scratch state on the
// per-connection userData object.
//
// The adapter needs to track per-connection state (the topic Set used
// to populate CloseContext.subscriptions, the coalesce-by-key buffer
// used by sendCoalesced) somewhere accessible from the WebSocket
// message handler. Stashing it on userData keeps the access pattern
// fast - the WS message handler already has userData in hand via
// ws.getUserData() and a property lookup is cheaper than a WeakMap.
//
// Using Symbol-keyed properties (rather than dunder strings like
// '__subscriptions') prevents collisions with arbitrary user upgrade
// hook returns: a user that does `return { __subscriptions: ... }`
// from upgrade() can no longer clobber the adapter's tracking, and
// Object.keys / JSON.stringify / spread on userData skip these slots
// so they do not leak into client serializations.
//
// The symbols use Symbol.for(...) so handler.js, vite.js, and testing.js
// (and downstream consumers like svelte-adapter-uws-extensions/redis/registry)
// all resolve to the SAME global symbol regardless of whether utils.js
// was bundled into a build artifact or loaded from node_modules at runtime.
// Plain `Symbol(description)` would create a new unique value per file
// instance, and a bundler that duplicates utils.js (vite's SSR output
// bundles handler.js + utils.js into build/) would produce two distinct
// symbols for the same conceptual slot - the handler would stamp under
// one symbol and a runtime-loaded extension (e.g. the cluster registry)
// would read under the other, silently dropping every cross-module lookup.
// The trade-off is that user code that calls Symbol.for('adapter-uws.ws.*')
// can now reach these slots; that is a deliberate accept since the
// alternative was a silent cluster-routing break in production.
