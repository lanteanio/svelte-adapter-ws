// Response-splitting guard for headers written onto the 101 handshake.
//
// uWS writes these headers VERBATIM into the handshake response, so a CR, LF or
// NUL in a value - or a name outside the RFC 7230 token alphabet - splits the
// response and lets an app that composes untrusted data into a header inject
// arbitrary response lines.
//
// This module is the SINGLE definition, imported by every surface that can write
// a handshake header: the production runtime, the upgradeResponse() helper (which
// validates at construction so the failure surfaces inside the app's own hook),
// and the in-process test server. Those three previously carried their own
// copies kept in step by a comment asking a human to remember, which is how the
// test server ended up without the check at all - an app could verify its
// handshake against the test server, see a clean pass, and ship a splittable
// header to production. A shared predicate makes that class of divergence
// impossible rather than merely discouraged.
