// Shared invariant predicates: pure functions of a plain state snapshot that
// return the first violation they find (or null). They are the single source of
// truth for "what correct server state looks like", imported by both the
// in-process consistency auditor (which builds a snapshot from live worker
// state on a background timer) and the deterministic simulator (which builds
// the same snapshot after every step). Keeping the predicates here - not inline
// in either consumer - means a tightened invariant tightens both at once.
//
// A snapshot is a plain, structure-only object. It carries NO payload bytes and
// NO user data; only the bookkeeping shapes an invariant needs. The canonical
// snapshot shape:
//
//   {
//     connections: [{ id, subscribed: string[], bookkeeping: string[] | null }],
//     topicCounts: { [topic]: number },   // subscribers per topic
//     totalSubscriptions: number          // running cap accountant
//   }
//
// Each predicate accepts that snapshot (or the subset it needs) and returns
// `null` when the invariant holds, or `{ category, context }` describing the
// first violation. `category` is a stable `<area>.<thing>` string reused as the
// metric label and the assert/fatal category; `context` is a small serialisable
// object for the structured log - never raw payloads.
//
// This module is dependency-free and reads no clock/RNG/timer, so it is safe to
// import anywhere and trivially deterministic.

/**
 * Fold a structure-only state projection into a single unsigned 32-bit integer
 * that is stable across runs and processes and order-independent over its input.
 *
 * INPUT CONTRACT: `{ topicSeqs }` where `topicSeqs` is a `Record<string, number>`
 * mapping a topic string to the highest non-negative `seq` that topic was
 * observed at. It is a PLAIN, already-extracted object - this module never learns
 * the in-memory app shape; the caller does the extraction. Any other property on
 * the input object is ignored, so two inputs that agree on `topicSeqs` hash
 * identically regardless of what else they carry.
 *
 * PRIVACY (structure only): the returned value carries no recoverable
 * identifiers. Topic strings are folded into the hash but never appear verbatim
 * in the integer; nothing else is read. No payload bytes, no event names, no data
 * values, no presence data, no connection/user keys, no ws ids, no subscriber
 * counts contribute.
 *
 * ORDERING: insertion order must not change the result. Each `[topic, seq]` entry
 * is reduced to a per-entry FNV digest folding the topic STRING and the integer
 * seq (rendered with `String(seq)`, with a `:` separator so a topic/seq boundary
 * cannot collide). The per-entry digests are combined with unsigned 32-bit
 * modular addition, which is commutative and associative, so any iteration order
 * yields the same accumulator. The accumulator starts from a count-seeded base so
 * a state with the same digests but a different number of topics (e.g. one extra
 * zero-seq topic) cannot collide.
 *
 * This is a structural divergence DETECTOR, not a cryptographic commitment: a
 * 32-bit fold has a birthday bound, but a real divergence almost always moves a
 * seq integer, which moves that entry's digest. A later consumer can widen to 64
 * bits if collision risk ever matters.
 *
 * SCOPE: this compares MAXIMA, which is a question no single worker can answer
 * about itself - holding a lower maximum than a sibling is only knowable by
 * comparison, which is what the majority vote over this hash is for. A lost
 * INTERIOR frame is the opposite kind of fact: the worker that lost it can tell
 * on its own (see the lead adapter's handler/state.js `recordOriginStream`), so it is reported
 * directly rather than voted on, and deliberately does NOT enter this hash.
 *
 * @param {{ topicSeqs?: Record<string, number> }} projection

 * Partition the delivered-seq map into ACTIVE topics (whose seq changed within

 *
 * The split exists because a maximum-based comparison over quiet topics can
 * never converge for a respawned worker: it comes back with an empty map and
 * re-learns a topic only when someone publishes it again, so a permanently
 * quiet topic keeps its siblings' hashes disagreeing with the respawn forever
 * - and under the restart-on-divergence switch that is a kill loop driven by a
 * topic nobody is publishing. Splitting lets the active comparison keep its
 * restart authority (an active topic self-heals or genuinely diverged) while
 * quiet disagreement becomes a log-only fact of worker lifecycle.
 *
 * Activity is derived on the REPORTER tick, by diffing against the previous
 * tick's snapshot - the publish and relay hot paths are untouched, pay no
 * clock read and no extra write. Ticks are per-worker counters over the same
 * configured interval, so "changed within the last tick" is comparable across
 * workers to within one interval of skew; the detector's persistence gate
 * absorbs a report landing inside that skew window.
