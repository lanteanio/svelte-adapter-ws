/**
 * SSRF-defence URL validator for svelte-adapter-ws.
 *
 * Server-side handlers that fetch a user-supplied URL (an outbound webhook,
 * a link-preview fetch, an avatar-from-URL import) are a classic
 * server-side request forgery (SSRF) target: an attacker submits a URL that
 * points at an internal address - the cloud instance-metadata endpoint
 * (`169.254.169.254`, which hands out IAM credentials), a loopback admin
 * panel, or an RFC1918 service - and the server fetches it from inside the
 * trust boundary. `isSafeUrl` answers the question "is it safe to fetch
 * this URL" with a single boolean.
 *
 * The validator is pure logic with no `node:dns` import: the synchronous
 * `isSafeUrl` / `checkUrl` classify the URL's *literal* host. A host that is
 * a numeric IP (in any encoding) is normalised and matched against the
 * blocked ranges; a host that is a DNS name is classified on its literal
 * text only. To close the DNS-rebinding gap - a public-looking name that
 * resolves to a private address - the caller passes a resolver to the async
 * `checkUrlResolved`, which resolves the name and re-checks the address.
 * Keeping the resolver an argument (rather than importing `node:dns`) keeps
 * the module isomorphic and trivially testable.
 *
 * The ecosystem's canonical copy lives in svelte-adapter-uws (the lead
 * adapter); this package carries the same validator so `./safe-url` resolves
 * identically whichever adapter an app installs. The family conformance
 * suite holds the two in lockstep.
 *
 * Blocked classes (in `strict` and `allowlist` modes):
 *
 * - loopback: IPv4 `127.0.0.0/8`, IPv6 `::1`, and the `localhost` hostname
 * - link-local IPv4: `169.254.0.0/16`
 * - cloud metadata: `169.254.169.254`, the IPv6 form `fd00:ec2::254`, and the
 *   `metadata.google.internal` and bare `metadata` hostnames (reported as
 *   `metadata`) - on GCP the DNS search domain makes the short spelling reach
 *   the same endpoint
 * - RFC1918 private IPv4: `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16`
 * - RFC 6598 CGNAT shared address space: `100.64.0.0/10` (reported as
 *   `cgnat`) - carrier-grade NAT internals, Tailscale, and Alibaba Cloud's
 *   instance metadata at `100.100.100.200`
 * - other special-purpose IPv4: IETF protocol assignments `192.0.0.0/24`
 *   (which include the RFC 7050 NAT64 discovery names), benchmark
 *   `198.18.0.0/15`, multicast `224.0.0.0/4`, and reserved `240.0.0.0/4`
 * - unspecified IPv4 `0.0.0.0/8` and IPv6 `::`
 * - IPv6 unique-local (ULA): `fc00::/7` (both `fc00::/8` and `fd00::/8`), and
 *   deprecated site-local `fec0::/10`, still routed on older internal networks
 * - IPv6 link-local `fe80::/10` and multicast `ff00::/8`
 * - IPv4-mapped / IPv4-compatible / IPv4-translated IPv6 (`::ffff:a.b.c.d`,
 *   `::a.b.c.d`, `::ffff:0:a.b.c.d`) are unwrapped to the embedded IPv4 and
 *   re-checked against every IPv4 rule, so `::ffff:169.254.169.254` cannot
 *   smuggle the metadata IP past an IPv4-only check
 * - IPv4-embedding transition mechanisms, unwrapped and re-checked the same
 *   way: NAT64 across the whole of `64:ff9b::/32`, read at all six prefix
 *   lengths RFC 6052 section 2.2 defines, since the address text does not
 *   record which one produced it; 6to4 `2002::/16`; and ISATAP (RFC 5214),
 *   which has no prefix of its own and is recognised by its `0000:5efe` /
 *   `0200:5efe` interface identifier under any unicast prefix. Teredo
 *   `2001::/32` is blocked outright (reported as `reserved`): it embeds two
 *   IPv4 addresses, the client's obfuscated at bits 96-127 and the server's in
 *   the clear at 32-63, and the mechanism has no legitimate public web use, so
 *   the range is refused rather than decoded
 * - NOTE on the NAT64 span: IANA assigns only `64:ff9b::/96` (RFC 6052) and
 *   `64:ff9b:1::/48` (RFC 8215) inside `64:ff9b::/32`, and RFC 6052 section
 *   2.2 says the well-known prefix "can only be used in the last form of the
 *   table", i.e. at /96. Matching the whole /32 and reading the shorter
 *   layouts is therefore a deliberate fail-closed choice over space no
 *   deployment is entitled to use - NOT, as this once claimed, the literal
 *   reading of the RFC. It costs real destinations; see `checkUrl` on how a
 *   deployment pins its own prefix to avoid paying for it
 * - bad scheme: anything that is not `http:` or `https:` (blocks `file:`,
 *   `gopher:`, `ftp:`, `data:`, `redis:`, ...)
 *
 * IP-obfuscation evasions are normalised before matching: decimal
 * (`http://2130706433/`), hex (`http://0x7f000001/`, `http://0x7f.0.0.1/`),
 * octal (`http://0177.0.0.1/`), and short forms (`http://127.1/`). Userinfo
 * smuggling (`http://expected.com@127.0.0.1/`) is defeated by reading the
 * parsed `URL.hostname`, never the raw string.
 *

	// u-octet, the padding after the embedded address - is under the sender's
	// control and is not part of the embedded address at that length. Gating on
	// either one hands an attacker an off switch: dirty the bits that the
	// reading which sees the private address does not use, and that reading is
	// discarded while a public-looking one at another length acquits the
	// address. `64:ff9b:1:a9fe:a9:fe00:808:808` is 169.254.169.254 under the
	// RFC 8215 /48 with a junk suffix, and it must not be reachable.
	//
	// The only thing skipped is a reading landing in 0.0.0.0/8, which is the
	// padding artifact of a LONGER prefix's encoding rather than a destination -
	// unless every reading lands there, in which case the address really is
	// unspecified.
	//
	// That skip is bounded by construction, and the bound holds no matter how any
	// range is NAMED: the skip is a range test on the address bits themselves - a
	// zero leading octet - so the set it can suppress is exactly 0.0.0.0/8
	// whatever a future rule decides to call that space. It can never hide a
	// loopback, RFC1918, metadata or any other destination.
	//
	// What it does leave reachable is 0.0.0.0/8 itself, and that residual is real
	// rather than theoretical. Reaching loopback by way of 0.0.0.0 is not merely
	// a connect(2) quirk: Linux substitutes the loopback route inside
	// __ip_route_output_key_hash, the generic output-route lookup every in-kernel
	// caller reaches, so a NAT64 translator that routes its own translated packet
	// through it - Jool does, without validating the destination - lands on the
	// translator's loopback. RFC 7915 requires no destination validation, and RFC
	// 6052 section 3.1's MUST-drop is scoped to the well-known prefix, which none
	// of the reachable shapes use. The floor is therefore blind SSRF against the
	// translator appliance itself, and the bound above is what stops it reaching
	// the calling host's own metadata or RFC1918.
	//
	// ALL OF THE ABOVE is what a deployment that has NOT declared its prefix
	// pays. When the EXACT `nat64Prefix` is supplied, the ambiguity disappears:
	// the length is known, so exactly one reading is taken, nothing is padding,
	// and both the over-block and the 0.0.0.0/8 residual go to zero. The declared

 *   is worse for a `/96` sourced from `64:ff9b:1::/48`, where the subnet id

 *   every public destination outright.
 *
 *   Declaring the exact prefix removes the ambiguity: exactly one reading is

 *   residual go to zero. A private embedded address is still refused.
 *
 *   DECLARE THE EXACT PREFIX THE TRANSLATOR USES. This option is a TRUSTED
 *   ASSERTION about the network. A parseable wrong length in EITHER direction
 *   can turn an address the guard would otherwise refuse into an allowed one:
 *   a shorter declaration reads prefix bits as the destination, while a longer
 *   declaration reads destination and suffix bits. The real length is not
 *   recoverable from the address text, and trying every length would restore the
 *   over-block this option exists to remove. A non-zero suffix proves some
 *   mismatches and is refused, but a clean suffix does not prove the declaration
 *   correct. Only an UNPARSEABLE value is safe by default - that one is ignored
