 * what the test harness sends to its connected WS clients - every frame
 * routed through `sendOutboundT` (`platform.publish`, `platform.send`,
 * `platform.sendTo`, `platform.request`, the welcome envelope, subscribe
 * acks, the resumed ack). It does NOT cover transport-level traffic
 * outside the harness: an ioredis client, a pg connection, a NATS
 * subscription, or any backend you've wired up alongside the adapter
 * stays untouched. For cross-wire fault injection, wrap the transport
 * client at the integration layer using the same `createChaosState`
