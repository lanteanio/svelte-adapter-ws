/**
 * Qualifiers that make a `key` a CREDENTIAL.
 *
 * THE QUALIFIER DECIDES, NOT THE WORD `key`. That is the whole rule, and it
 * replaced two earlier attempts that both got it backwards.
 *
 * `key` is one of the most overloaded words in software. It is a database
 * identity (`primaryKey`, `sortKey`, `hashKey`, `rangeKey`), a lookup
 * (`cacheKey`, `columnKey`, `routeKey`), an i18n handle (`translationKey`,
 * `i18nKey`, `messageKey`, `localeKey`), a UI identity (`reactKey`, `listKey`,
 * `tabKey`), a keyboard event (`keyCode`, `heldKeys`) and a musical one
 * (`musicKey`). None of those is a secret.
 *
 * An earlier rule inverted this into an ALLOWLIST of benign qualifiers, on the
 * reasoning that the space of credential qualifiers is open. That is true, but
 * so is the space of benign ones - and measuring it settled the argument:
 * the allowlist dropped 38 of 41 ordinary product field names, including the
 * canonical DynamoDB `hashKey` / `rangeKey` and the standard i18n family. A
 * default that breaks most apps is not a safe default, it is a broken one, and
 * the drop-everything direction was chosen on a premise that did not survive
 * being counted.
 *
 * So a `key` is benign unless something else in the name says otherwise. This
 * list is that something. It is a denylist and therefore cannot close; a novel
 * credential qualifier passes until it is added, exactly as `SENSITIVE_WORDS`
 * cannot close either. The compensating controls are the flat compounds below,
 * the unambiguous credential words (`secret`, `token`, `password`,
 * `credential`), and a reported drop naming any field the projection removes.

/**
 * Memoised verdicts for {@link isUnsafeProjectionFieldName}.
 *
 * The projection runs once per connection, not once per broadcast: `select` is
 * called from `presence.join()` and from the cursor's ws-state creation, and
 * measuring the object walk shows 200 joins produce 200 walks while updates,
 * flushes and `list()` produce none. So this memo serves a per-connection path.
 * It still earns its place - word matching answers a name with two
 * tokenizations, a joined normalization and several set lookups, which is
 * roughly 900ns against 4ns for a hit - but it is not sitting on a fan-out hot
 * path, and it must not be tuned as though a miss were catastrophic.
 *
 * THE HIT PATH DOES NOTHING BUT READ, and that is the policy decision. Three
 * eviction schemes were measured against a client that can influence the names
 * on a projected object (an upgrade hook spreading the request context puts
 * header names there):
 *
 *   - Filling and then freezing forever assumed the app connects before an
 *     attacker. It does not: a hostile client filling all 1024 slots first
 *     meant the app's own names were never cached again for the life of the
 *     process, and unlike every other policy it never recovered.
 *   - Least-recently-used, implemented the only way a `Map` allows - delete
 *     and re-set the key on every HIT - was far worse. Touching a live key in
 *     a full table thrashes V8's shrink/grow: 754ns per hit at the cap against
 *     ~4ns for a plain read, which is what recomputing the verdict costs
 *     anyway, and 120ns even after the flood stopped. It also did not prevent
 *     starvation, since a flood wider than the table evicts the app's names
 *     regardless. A cache whose hit path costs as much as a miss is not one.
 *   - Oldest-inserted, evicting only on a MISS, leaves the hit path a single
 *     `Map.get`. Under a flood it degrades to roughly the cost of no cache,
 *     and it returns to full speed the moment the flood stops.
 *
 * The last is what ships. The table also refuses to store a long name at all,
 * so the entry cap doubles as a byte cap rather than retaining up to
 * `1024 * maxNameLength` of client-influenced strings.
