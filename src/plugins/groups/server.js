/**
 * Broadcast groups plugin for svelte-adapter-ws.
 *
 * Named groups with explicit membership, roles, metadata, and lifecycle
 * hooks. Like topics but with access control - you decide who can join,
 * who can publish, and what happens when the group fills up or closes.
 *
 * Zero impact on the adapter core - this module only uses the tracked
 * subscribe/unsubscribe helpers (native membership plus the subscription
 * registry the binary publish walk delivers by), platform.publish(), and
 * platform.send().
 *
 * MULTI-TENANT NOTE
 * Group state is keyed by the group name verbatim. In a single-process
 * deployment with multiple tenants, two tenants creating a group with
 * the same name (`'admins'`, `'staff'`) collide on the SAME state.
 * Apps must namespace group names with a tenant scope:
 *
 *     createGroup('org-' + tenantId + ':admins', { ... })
 *
 * Same recommendation for `presence`, `replay`, and `cursor` plugins.
 *
 * @module svelte-adapter-ws/plugins/groups

// A group is joined by the client subscribing to `__group:<name>`, and the only

// that hook a side effect stops it disarming the grant gate for every other
// topic; declaring the prefix is the other half, so the gate does not refuse
// the group's own channel before the hook it defers to has run. The hook still
// decides, and still refuses an admission-denied, full, or closed group. The
// system-topic guard consults the same prefix registry; landing still requires
// join() to have established tracked membership, so other __group:* spellings
// do not inherit access.
