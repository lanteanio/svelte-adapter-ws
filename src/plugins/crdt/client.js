/**
 * Client-side CRDT document wire for svelte-adapter-ws.
 *
 * Registers the CRDT binary wire codec as a SINK on the `__crdt:` topic prefix:
 * an inbound `0x03` frame on a CRDT topic is decoded to its opaque
 * `{ op, bytes }` and applied in place, and the framework dispatches NO store
 * event for it (the `sink: true` contract). A sink codec drives its own
 * reactive surface and recovers its own resume position - a CRDT resyncs via a
 * state-vector SYNC_REQUEST rather than seq replay - so the framework does not
 * track per-topic seq for this topic.
 *
 * This unit ships the wire only. The document replica that consumes the bytes
 * (the `live.doc` / `live.map` / `live.array` reactive stores) is a separate
 * concern that subscribes to the frames exposed here via {@link onCrdtFrame}.
 * The bytes stay opaque end to end: this module never interprets an update.
 *
 * Registering at module load means the first `hello` already advertises
 * `crdt.protocol:1`, so the server sends compact `0x03` frames from the start; a
 * connection that imports this module is binary-capable. A client that does NOT
 * import it advertises no CRDT capability and transparently receives the JSON
 * frame instead, with no update lost.
 *
