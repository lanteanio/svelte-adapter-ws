/**
 * Client-side channel for one CRDT document topic: the local replica every
 * read hits, the wire glue that keeps it converged with the server's, and
 * the container facets (map / array / text) a reactive layer wraps.
 *
 * The TRANSPORT is injected (the smooth-channel discipline): the caller
 * supplies `sendUpdate(bytes)` (a reliable no-reply upstream send),
 * `sync(stateVector)` (an awaited request returning the access record, the
 * resolved wire topic, the missing-structs diff, and the server's own state
 * vector), and optionally `close()` (tells the server this mount is gone).
 * Injection keeps this module free of any framework above the adapter and
 * makes the channel drivable by a deterministic harness with a scripted
 * transport.
 *
 * Convergence model - one idempotent commutative merge everywhere:
 *
 *   - A local write applies to the local replica synchronously (there is no
 *     pending state) and emits one opaque update on the wire per transaction.
 *   - A remote update applies with a remote origin, so it is never echoed
 *     back out.
 *   - On every connection 'open' (first connect and every reconnect) the
 *     channel syncs: it sends its state vector, applies the server's diff,
 *     and uploads `encodeStateAsUpdate(localDoc, serverStateVector)` - so the
 *     local replica IS the offline queue and a two-hour offline session
 *     reconnects with one bounded blob, no frame bookkeeping.
 *   - Frames that arrive while the FIRST sync is in flight (before the wire
 *     topic is known) are buffered and replayed after the reply names the
 *     topic; replaying overlap is a no-op because the merge is idempotent.
 *   - After every apply the channel checks the replica's pending-structs
 *     gauge: a dependency gap means a frame was lost somewhere (backpressure,
 *     a dropped JSON fallback, anything) and schedules a debounced resync -
 *     the CRDT analog of ack-famine recovery. The detector needs a causally
 *     LATER struct to arrive and reference the missing one, so it cannot see
 *     a TERMINAL drop (the lost update was the last edit to reach this
 *     replica); a low-frequency background reconcile on the healthy channel
 *     re-runs the same state-vector exchange and closes that path too, so
 *     every silent drop converges without waiting for a reconnect.
 *
 * Read-only mounts: when the access record says `write: false`, the facet
 * mutators throw. A CRDT cannot "reconcile away" local-only edits (nothing
 * deletes them), so silently accepting writes that the server will reject
 * would fork the local view forever; failing fast plus the surfaced
 * `readOnly` flag (so the UI disables inputs) is the honest contract.
