 * Subscribe to decoded CRDT frames as they are applied in place by the sink

 * each inbound CRDT `0x03` frame; `bytes` is the opaque CRDT blob, handed back
 * verbatim for a local replica to apply. A handler that throws is isolated so
 * one bad consumer cannot drop the frame for another.
 *
 * Importing this module opts the connection into binary CRDT frames: the first
 * `hello` advertises `crdt.protocol:1` and inbound CRDT frames are routed
 * through the sink decode, which dispatches no store event.
 *
 * @param handler - called with each applied frame
 * @returns an unsubscribe function
 *
 * @example
 * ```js
 * import { onCrdtFrame } from 'svelte-adapter-ws/plugins/crdt/client';
 *
 * const off = onCrdtFrame(({ op, bytes }) => {
 *   // hand the opaque bytes to a local document replica
 * });
