/**
 * Server-side CRDT document authority: the per-topic replica set behind
 * `live.doc` / `live.map` / `live.array`.
 *
 * One authority instance manages every active document topic for one
 * declaration: a per-topic Yjs replica (the authoritative copy new joiners
 * sync against), reference-counted lifecycle, the durable persistence
 * schedule, and the access-record normalization for the `{read, write,
 * comment}` guard. The wire stays the shipped CRDT codec's concern; this
 * module never frames bytes, it produces and consumes them:
 *
 *   - `acquire(topic)` loads the durable state once per cold topic (concurrent
 *     joiners coalesce on one in-flight load - the hydrate-stampede gate) and
 *     counts a reference.
 *   - `applyUpdate(topic, bytes)` merges an inbound update into the replica
 *     and returns the normalized bytes for the caller to fan out verbatim.
 *   - `diff(topic, stateVector)` answers a joiner's sync with exactly the
 *     structs it lacks; `stateVector(topic)` is the server's own summary so
 *     the client can upload what the SERVER lacks - the two-way exchange that
 *     makes reconnect and offline recovery one idempotent round trip.
 *   - `release(topic)` drops a reference; the last release runs the final
 *     store (edit-then-disconnect is never lost) and unloads the replica.
 *
 * Persistence is scheduled, never inline on the message path: a trailing
 * debounce (`debounceWait`) with a sustained-edit force (`debounceMaxWait`),
 * an update-count compaction trigger (`snapshotEvery`), and the on-empty
 * final store (`persistOnEmpty`). The durable artifact is always the full
 * document state in one blob (`encodeStateAsUpdate`), captured synchronously
 * at schedule time so a consistent point is stored; the host app owns the
 * I/O through the `persist.load` / `persist.store` hooks and this module owns
 * only the schedule. A flapping client cannot multiply `store` calls: the
 * debounce coalesces and the final store runs once per empty transition.
 *
 * The scheduled path is best-effort by design (a failed store retries, an
 * operator watches `onError`), but an EXPLICIT flush - `persistNow()`, the
 * shutdown path - is not: it is bounded by a deadline so a host store that
 * never settles cannot wedge the exit, and it resolves to the per-topic
 * outcome (durable / declined / failed / timed out / still dirty) so a caller
 * can never mistake "every store rejected" for "everything is durable". The
 * host's own I/O is bounded with it: each `load` / `store` call receives an
 * `AbortSignal` that fires when the flush deadline expires or the authority
 * is torn down. Giving up on a write is never the same as it succeeding: an
 * abandoned store's answer is discarded whatever it turns out to be - the
 * alternative, trusting whatever a cancelled write reports, is how a flush
 * would report bytes durable that were never written. When it was a flush
 * deadline that gave up, the captured state also goes back to dirty and the
 * retry schedule takes it; a teardown (`drop`, `destroy`) has no record left
 * to reschedule and is not a persistence fault either.
 *
 * The document bytes are opaque to the wire codec but NOT to this module:
 * this is the one place the CRDT library lives server-side. Yjs types never
 * leak through the public surface.
