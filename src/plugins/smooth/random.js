/**
 * Deterministic randomness for predicted commands.
 *
 * A command that draws randomness must draw the SAME value everywhere the
 * command is applied: on the client's first prediction, on every client
 * replay during reconciliation, and on the server's authoritative apply.
 * Anything else turns every randomised command into a guaranteed
 * misprediction. The contract that makes this hold is seeding: the generator
 * is reseeded from the command's id immediately before each application, so
 * the same command always replays the same draw sequence no matter how many
 * times, or on which side, it runs.
 *
 * Calling `Math.random()` inside an apply function is the documented mistake:
 * it breaks the parity between prediction and authority that reconciliation
 * depends on.
 *
 * The generator is a mulberry32 stream over a golden-ratio-scrambled seed:
 * pure 32-bit integer arithmetic, identical results in every JS engine, a
 * few nanoseconds per draw. One instance is created per consumer and reseeded
 * per command, so the replay loop allocates nothing.
 *
 * Pure: no clocks, no timers, no imports, no global state.
