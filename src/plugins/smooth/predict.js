/**
 * Client-side prediction with server-authoritative reconciliation.
 *
 * The invariant, enforced everywhere here: predictions are suggestions; the
 * server's output is truth. The local entity responds to input on the same
 * frame it happens by applying the developer's `apply(state, command, ctx)`
 * immediately, while every applied command waits in a sliding window of
 * un-acknowledged commands. When the server acknowledges command N with its
 * authoritative state, the window drops everything up to N, rebases on the
 * server's state, and REPLAYS the surviving tail through the same `apply` -
 * so the prediction is always "server truth plus exactly the commands the
 * server has not seen yet".
 *
 * With a correctly written `apply` the replayed prediction equals the old
 * one and nothing is visible. When they differ, the divergence is measured
 * by `computeError` and the correction is handled by perceptibility:
 *
 *   - divergence at or below `errorThreshold` snaps silently - a correction
 *     too small to see needs no easing, and easing it would smear precision;
 *   - divergence above the threshold keeps the RENDERED position continuous
 *     by recording the visual error as an offset that decays to zero over
 *     `smoothTimeMs`. The simulation state itself snaps to the corrected
 *     value immediately - only the pixels lag the correction, the next
 *     replay never builds on a lie.
 *
 * Replay re-runs commands many times, so `apply` must be pure with respect
 * to one-shot effects: `ctx.firstTime` is true only on a command's initial
 * application and false on every replay - guard sounds and other one-shot
 * side effects on it. `ctx.rng` is reseeded from the command id before every
 * application, so randomness drawn inside `apply` survives reconciliation
 * (see ./random.js). `ctx.key` is the predicting entity's own key, read from
 * the caller's `self` accessor (the authority sets the same key when it
 * applies the command, so an `apply` that reads it stays deterministic); it
 * is null until the caller learns its identity.
 *
 * The prediction advances one command per simulation tick, but displays
 * refresh faster than tick rate - a 120Hz panel over a 60Hz simulation
 * would render every predicted position twice, and that stair-step reads
 * as a velocity-proportional smear when the eye tracks the moving entity.
 * `renderInto` therefore sweeps each tick's motion across the measured
 * command cadence: at a command's application the rendered position stays
 * where the previous sweep had it and glides to the new prediction over
 * (slightly more than) one command interval, so a faster display samples
 * forward motion on every frame. The sweep engages only on a tick-like
 * cadence (gaps up to 100ms); sporadic commands snap exactly as before.
 * The window over-estimates the cadence by a quarter so a late command
 * lands while the previous sweep is still in flight - the remainder folds
 * into the next sweep and the motion never stalls or overshoots.
 *
 * The window is bounded by count and by age. Exceeding either bound means
 * the server has effectively gone silent: prediction is KILLED rather than
 * allowed to run away - the window clears, the entity renders the last
 * authoritative state, and `overflowed` reads true so the owner can resync
 * (a full-state sync plus the next acknowledgement re-engage prediction).
 * Acknowledgements are idempotent: anything at or below the last applied
 * ack is ignored, so a replayed or stale ack can never double-apply.
 *
 * Command ids are monotonic for the lifetime of the predictor and survive
 * `reset()` - a reconnect rebases state but never reuses an id, so a late
 * acknowledgement from the previous stream can never be confused for one
 * from the current stream.
 *
 * Pure: no clocks, no timers, no imports beyond the sibling random module.
 * Every time reading is a caller-supplied monotonic-milliseconds argument.
