/**
 * Server-side pieces of the smoothing primitive: the authoritative command
 * processor and the smooth wire codec factory.
 *
 * The authority owns the invariant the whole primitive rests on: a client
 * can only ever send COMMANDS, never push state. Each entity (one per owning
 * connection per topic) holds the authoritative state, a bounded queue of
 * commands awaiting the next tick, and the id of the last command applied.
 * A tick drains every queued command in arrival order through the SAME
 * `apply(state, command, ctx)` the clients predict with, then reports which
 * entities changed (for the broadcast) and which owners need an
 * acknowledgement (always carrying the authoritative state - the ack IS the
 * owner's copy of truth, which is what lets the broadcast skip echoing the
 * owner's own entity back to it).
 *
 * Commands are drained whole per tick rather than paced one-per-tick:
 * commands are frame-coalesced input samples arriving on a reliable in-order
 * transport, so pacing would add queue latency without fairness gain. A tick
 * with an EMPTY queue holds the entity unchanged unless an `onMissing(state,
 * lastCommand)` hook is supplied (a genuinely simulated entity continues its
 * motion there); `onMissing` returning the same state reference (or
 * undefined) signals rest, and a resting entity stops costing ticks until
 * its next command.
 *
 * `ctx.rng` is reseeded from each command's id before it is applied - the
 * same id-seeded draw the client makes on prediction and replay, so
 * randomness inside `apply` cannot diverge (see ./random.js). `ctx.firstTime`
 * is always true here: the authority applies a command exactly once.
 * `ctx.key` names the entity whose command is being applied - the handle an
 * authoritative side effect attributes to (who fired the shot, whose action
 * to log). It is the same key the predicting client sees for its own entity,
 * so an `apply` that reads it stays deterministic across both sides.
 *
 * Re-binding an entity to a new connection (the same identity reconnecting)
 * resets its acknowledgement watermark: command ids belong to the CLIENT
 * stream, and a fresh socket means a fresh stream whose ids the authority
 * simply echoes. The queue is dropped with the old socket - un-acked
 * commands from a dead connection are gone by definition, and the client
 * rebases through its sync request rather than blind-replaying onto a basis
 * it no longer shares.
 *
 * The authority is pure with respect to time and transport: no clocks, no
 * timers, no publishes - the caller owns the tick cadence and delivers the
 * drain result. That is also the ordering contract the broadcast needs:
 * `apply` is pure state -> state, so nothing can publish mid-drain, and the
 * caller publishes updates and acknowledgements only after the drain
 * returns - subscribers always observe a tick's effects atomically.
