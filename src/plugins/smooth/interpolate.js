/**
 * Render-in-the-past interpolation for remote entities.
 *
 * Each remote entity keeps a fixed-size ring of `(t, x, y)` samples on the
 * server time axis. A render frame computes one render time - the estimated
 * server "now" minus an interpolation delay - and asks each ring for the
 * position at that instant:
 *
 *   - When two samples straddle the render time, the position is the linear
 *     interpolation between them, found by a backward scan from the newest
 *     sample (one or two steps in the steady state).
 *   - When the buffer has run dry (consecutive missed frames), the position
 *     extrapolates along the last observed velocity, but only up to a hard
 *     cap - past it the entity rests where extrapolation left it rather than
 *     flying off on a stale heading.
 *   - When the straddling pair spans more than `snapGapMs`, the gap is a
 *     discontinuity (the entity left the subscriber's view, an idle pause, a
 *     resumed delivery) and the position snaps to the newer sample instead of
 *     smearing across the screen for the length of the gap.
 *   - When the straddling pair covers ground the entity's own neighbouring
 *     samples come nowhere near, it is a discontinuity too: a teleport or a
 *     scripted placement delivered on the ordinary cadence has its samples one
 *     interval apart like any other pair, so the time test above cannot see
 *     it. The comparison is the entity's OWN adjacent motion rather than an
 *     absolute speed, because one interpolator serves a cursor in CSS pixels
 *     and a game entity in arbitrary world units, and because an entity the
 *     app has never moved has no absolute baseline at all while it always has
 *     neighbouring samples. A pair is a jump only when it leaves the pair
 *     behind it - and the sample ahead of it, once one has arrived - behind by
 *     `JUMP_FACTOR`, so uniform motion, acceleration, deceleration and an
 *     abrupt stop all keep interpolating: each of those keeps an adjacent pair
 *     moving at a comparable speed.
 *   - `snapSpeedPerSec` names an absolute bound on top of that, for a topic
 *     that knows its own scale and wants an exact ceiling; `snapSpeedPerSec:
 *     0` turns both tests off and restores pure interpolation everywhere.
 *
 * Rendering remote entities slightly in the past is what makes a dropped or
 * late frame invisible: with the delay at two update intervals there is
 * almost always a real pair of samples around the render time. The cost is
 * stated once and plainly: remote entities are drawn `delay` milliseconds
 * behind their newest known position. The `'auto'` delay tracks the measured
 * stamp interval and collapses toward the floor when updates arrive at
 * display rate, so a fast LAN pays almost nothing.
 *
 * The hot path is allocation-free: rings are typed arrays allocated once per
 * entity, sampling writes into a caller-owned scratch point, and the per-key
 * Map is the only dynamic structure (entries appear on first sight of a key
 * and leave on remove/expiry/compaction).
 *
 * Pure: no clocks, no timers, no imports beyond the sibling clock module.
 * Callers pass every time reading in, so worker, main-thread fallback, and a
 * deterministic simulation harness run identical code.
