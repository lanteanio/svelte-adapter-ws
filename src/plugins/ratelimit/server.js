/**
 * Rate limit plugin for svelte-adapter-ws.
 *
 * Fixed-window rate limiter for inbound WebSocket messages.
 * Supports per-IP, per-connection, or custom key extraction,
 * with optional auto-ban when a bucket is exhausted.
 *
 * Fixed-window semantics: the allowance refills in full at each
 * interval boundary, so a client can fire a full window of messages
 * at the end of one interval and another full window at the start of
 * the next - up to 2x `points` inside a short seam. The adapter
 * core's upgrade limiter uses a sliding window to avoid exactly this.
 * If burst smoothness matters, prefer a smaller `points` / `interval`
 * pair with the same average rate.
 *
 * Zero impact on the adapter core - this is a standalone module
 * that you call from your `message` hook to decide whether to
 * process or drop a message.

/**
 * @typedef {Object} RateLimitOptions
 * @property {number} points - Allowance per interval. Must be a positive integer.
 * @property {number} interval - Refill interval in milliseconds. Must be positive.
 * @property {number} [blockDuration=0] - If > 0, automatically ban the key for this many
 *   milliseconds when the allowance is exhausted. Subsequent `consume()` calls return
 *   `{ allowed: false }` until the ban expires.
 * @property {'ip' | 'connection' | ((ws: any) => string)} [keyBy='ip'] - How to derive the
 *   rate-limit key from a WebSocket connection.
 *   - `'ip'` (default): uses `userData.remoteAddress`, `userData.ip`, or `'unknown'`
 *   - `'connection'`: each WebSocket object gets its own independent bucket
 *   - `function`: custom extractor, receives the ws and returns a string key
 * @property {(ws: any) => (string | null | undefined)} [tenant] - Optional per-connection
 *   tenant resolver. When set, the bucket key is scoped by the returned tenant id so two
 *   tenants sharing an IP / connection / custom key get independent buckets and a tenant's
 *   `reset` / `ban` / `unban` / `clear` touch only that tenant. Mirrors the `redis/ratelimit`
 *   extension. Return null/undefined for an unscoped connection. The id is joined to the key
 *   with a NUL, so it stays unambiguous even when the key is an IPv6 address.
 *
 *   When OMITTED, the limiter reads the tenant id from the connection's frozen
 *   attribution slot - the answer the adapter settled at open from the handler module's
 *   `attribution(user)` export - and no resolver runs. The slot never changes for a
 *   connection's life, so how often the limiter reads it is a cost detail per keyBy, not
 *   a semantic one. An explicit resolver overrides that read; a deployment with neither
 *   stays byte-identical single-tenant.
 * @property {'principal' | 'tenant'} [budget='principal'] - What one bucket's allowance
 *   covers inside a tenant's namespace. Both values keep tenants NAMESPACE-scoped (two
 *   tenants never share a bucket, and tenant-scoped admin ops touch only their tenant);
 *   the budget decides how a tenant's own traffic shares the allowance:
 *   - `'principal'` (default): each resolved key (IP, connection, custom) gets its own
 *     bucket inside the tenant's namespace - per-principal budget, today's behavior.
 *   - `'tenant'`: the bucket key is the tenant id alone, so ALL of a tenant's principals
 *     draw from ONE shared allowance - a fair-share ceiling per tenant. Every consumed
 *     connection must then carry a tenant id (from the `tenant` resolver or the adapter
 *     attribution); `consume` throws for one that does not, because a shared null bucket
 *     would be one global bucket, which is not what `budget: 'tenant'` means. Admin ops
 *     (`reset`/`ban`/`unban`) address the tenant's one bucket by the tenantId argument
 *     and do not read the key argument in this mode; calling one without a tenant id
 *     throws.
 * @property {number} [maxBuckets=1_000_000] - Hard cap on retained buckets. When the
 *   map crosses this size on a new insert, one entry is evicted to make room. The
 *   lazy expired-entry sweep at 1000+ entries still runs first; the hard cap protects
 *   against sustained DDoS where every entry is unexpired. The victim is the least
 *   active unbanned entry of a sample; see {@link createRateLimit}'s `evictOne` for
 *   what eviction does and does not guarantee about a ban.
 * @property {number} [evictionSample=16] - How many entries an eviction inspects
 *   before choosing its victim. Must be a positive integer. Larger samples choose
 *   better and cost more; the whole map is inspected when it holds fewer entries
 *   than this.
 * @property {(evicted: { key: string, banned: boolean }) => void} [onEvict] - Called
 *   once per eviction with the bucket key that was dropped (tenant-scoped, so it is
 *   `tenantId + '\0' + key` when a `tenant` resolver is set). `banned` is true when
 *   every sampled candidate was still serving a ban and enforcement state had to be
 *   dropped anyway - the case worth alerting on. Called after the call that triggered
 *   the eviction has finished deciding, so a listener that throws cannot change what
 *   that call charged or recorded, only rob its caller of the return value.

/**

 *   the limiter has not seen is an insert, so at `maxBuckets` it evicts another key's
 *   bucket to make room - an app that bans attacker-supplied ids therefore lets the

 * @property {(key: string, tenant?: string | null) => void} unban - Remove a ban (the window counter is untouched).

	/**
	 * Reclaim one slot for a key about to be inserted, and report what was dropped.
	 *
	 * Eviction must not be usable as a way to CLEAR ENFORCEMENT. A key serving a
	 * ban still owes it, and dropping its entry hands it a full fresh allowance on
	 * its next message, so anyone able to mint identities - a new address, a new
	 * value for a custom key - would otherwise push its own banned entry out of the
	 * map and walk straight back in. Two rules answer that:
	 *
	 * - A banned entry is not a candidate at all while any unbanned one is in the
	 *   sample, so an eviction that has an unbanned entry to take always takes it.
	 *   Note what that does NOT say: minted keys still occupy the map, and once
	 *   bans dominate it a sample can come up all-banned, which is the second rule
	 *   below. The guarantee is per eviction, not a promise that churn can never
	 *   reach a ban - `onEvict` reporting `banned: true` is how you learn it did,
	 *   and it means `maxBuckets` is too small for the bans in flight.
	 * - When every sampled candidate is banned something has to go, and it is the
	 *   most recently placed ban of that sample. Picking the soonest-expiring one
	 *   instead would target precisely the oldest ban in the map, which is the one
	 *   an attacker wants gone.
	 *
	 * The second rule decides inside the sample, so read what it guarantees at the
	 * far end: a sampled ban that is not the newest of its sample is never taken,
	 * therefore the ban placed longest ago in the WHOLE map is never taken (any
	 * other sampled ban outranks it, and an unbanned entry is preferred to it
	 * before that). Minting keys that deliberately exhaust themselves to earn a ban
	 * only ever adds bans newer than one already in the map, so a flood cannot
	 * clear the oldest ban. That holds wherever an eviction can see two entries at
	 * once - `evictionSample >= 2` and a cap above one bucket; a sample that lands
	 * on a single entry has no comparison to make and takes it.
	 *
	 * What that does NOT promise: a ban is not indestructible, and the choice is
	 * NOT map-wide. A map saturated with bans has to drop one to admit any new key,
	 * and the one dropped is only the newest of the entries this eviction happened
	 * to walk - newer bans elsewhere in the map are not consulted. So every ban but
	 * the oldest can be evicted, and traffic that first fills the map with a map's
	 * worth of its own bans can then have a ban placed after those taken out from
	 * under it by churn. Each such drop fires `onEvict` with `banned: true`, and
	 * sizing `maxBuckets` above the number of bans expected in flight is what keeps
	 * enforcement intact.
	 *
	 * Among unbanned candidates the victim is the lowest {@link activity} score; an
	 * elapsed window breaks a tie, since dropping such an entry forfeits nothing
	 * that its next message would not have restored anyway. Expiry is only a
	 * tiebreak: letting it win outright would feed eviction every client that
	 * messages more slowly than one interval, which is an ordinary client.
