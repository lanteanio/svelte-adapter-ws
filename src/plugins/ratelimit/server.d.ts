	 * tenant's own traffic shares the allowance:
	 *
	 * - `'principal'` (default): each resolved key (IP, connection, custom) gets its

	 * - `'tenant'`: the bucket key is the tenant id alone, so ALL of a tenant's
	 *   principals draw from ONE shared allowance - a fair-share ceiling per tenant.
	 *   Every consumed connection must then carry a tenant id (from the `tenant`
	 *   resolver, or from the adapter attribution); `consume` throws for one that
	 *   does not, because a shared bucket for every id-less connection would be one
	 *   global bucket, which is not what `budget: 'tenant'` means. Admin ops

	/**
	 * Hard cap on retained buckets. When the map crosses this size on a
	 * new insert, one entry is evicted to make room. The lazy expired-entry
	 * sweep at 1000+ entries still runs first; the hard cap protects against
	 * sustained DDoS where every entry is unexpired.
	 *
	 * The victim is the least active entry of a sample, where activity is the
	 * allowance drawn across the current window and the one before it - so a
	 * flood of one-shot identities is evicted in preference to a client that

	 * while any unbanned entry is in the sample; when every SAMPLED candidate
	 * is banned, the one dropped is the most recently placed ban OF THAT
	 * SAMPLE. That rule is sample-local, not map-wide: an eviction inspects
	 * `evictionSample` entries, so it can drop a ban while newer bans sit
	 * elsewhere in the map.
	 *
	 * What holds map-wide is the far end of the same rule: the ban placed
	 * longest ago is never the victim, because any other sampled ban outranks
	 * it and any sampled unbanned entry is preferred to it - so identity
	 * churn, which can only add newer bans, cannot clear the OLDEST ban in
	 * the map. That needs an eviction able to see two entries at once -
	 * `evictionSample >= 2` (the default is 16) and a cap above one bucket;
	 * a sample that lands on a single entry takes it, ban and all.
	 *
	 * It is not a promise that a ban always survives. A map saturated with
	 * bans must drop one to admit any new key, and past the oldest one any
	 * ban can be the one that goes - including a chosen one, if the traffic
	 * first fills the map with bans placed BEFORE the ban it wants gone.
	 * Every such drop is reported through `onEvict` with `banned: true`, and
	 * sizing `maxBuckets` above the number of bans you expect in flight is
	 * what actually keeps enforcement intact.
