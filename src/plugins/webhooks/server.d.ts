	 * THE RECEIVER CONTRACT, in full - the signature is worth nothing if the
	 * far side verifies it loosely:
	 *
	 * 1. Read `x-webhook-timestamp`. Reject unless it matches `/^\d+$/`. This
	 *    check is load-bearing, not hygiene: it is what makes the `.`
	 *    delimiter unambiguous, so a body containing a dot cannot be re-split
	 *    into a different timestamp/body pair that signs identically.
	 * 2. Reject if it is more than 300 seconds (5 minutes) from your own
	 *    clock, in either direction. Without this the signature never expires
	 *    and a captured delivery replays forever - which is the entire point
	 *    of signing the timestamp.
	 * 3. Recompute `HMAC_SHA256(secret, timestamp + '.' + rawBody)` over the
	 *    RAW body bytes, before any JSON parse and re-serialize.
	 * 4. Split `x-webhook-signature` on commas and accept if ANY entry matches,
	 *    comparing with a constant-time function (`crypto.timingSafeEqual`),
	 *    never `===`. Several entries appear only during a `previousSecret`
	 *    rotation, and both sign the same timestamped material.
	 *
	 * Freshness bounds replay; it does not make a request single-use inside the
	 * five-minute window. After successful verification, deduplicate on the
	 * authenticated signature header (or a unique event id inside the signed
	 * body). Do not use the mutable `idempotency-key` header by itself as a
	 * security replay token: that header is not part of the signed material.
	 *
	 * BREAKING vs the pre-timestamp contract: a receiver verifying
	 * `HMAC(secret, body)` rejects every delivery from a sender on this
	 * version. Update receivers BEFORE upgrading senders. A legacy body-only
	 * signature is deliberately not emitted alongside the new one - a receiver
	 * accepting either is still replayable through the legacy entry, which
	 * would leave the hole open while looking closed.

/** A first-attempt admission gate: `take` consumes one unit of a DESTINATION's
 * allowance, returning whether a delivery may start. In-process (sync) or
 * cluster-shared (async).
 *
 * A destination is `<address>:<port>` (IPv6 bracketed) - an address
 * `deliverWebhook`'s SSRF gate resolved and pinned the socket to, not
 * `WebhookDeliveryHooks.key` and not the URL. Callers name endpoints, so a key
 * or a URL origin can be multiplied by inventing names; a pinned address cannot
 * be renamed. `take` is called once for EVERY address in the pin, because which
 * of them the socket lands on is decided by the connect logic and the caller
 * orders its own DNS answer - so whichever address the request goes to has paid
 * for it. Registrations, aliases and per-event `url` callbacks that land on one
 * address therefore share that address's allowance.
 *
 * What that costs, stated here rather than left to be discovered:
 *
 * - A delivery to a host answering with several addresses spends one unit at
 *   EACH of them, so such an endpoint holds several allowances.
 * - A caller controlling its own DNS answer can pad it and spend UNRELATED
 *   addresses' allowances without sending them any traffic. The answer is capped
 *   at 32 addresses, so one admitted delivery can charge up to 32 buckets while
 *   one request goes out. Those addresses need not belong to the caller, so this
 *   is usable to exhaust a co-tenant's admission bucket; lower the cap or key
 *   deliveries per tenant if that matters to your deployment.
 * - A REDIRECT hop is not charged. The gate is consulted once, at hop zero,
 *   because charging a hop chosen by the endpoint being delivered to would let
 *   any registration drain a bystander. That leaves up to `maxRedirects`
 *   requests per admitted delivery unmetered by this gate (the address checks
 *   still run on every hop).
 * - A refusal part-way through a set keeps the units already taken, since the
 *   interface only takes, so a refused delivery can cost more than it sent,
 *   never less.
 *
 * What holds without qualification is narrower than any of the above: a request
 * cannot be put on an address at hop zero without spending that address's unit.
 *
 * Only a definite `false` (or the `0` a Lua-scripted shared backend replies
 * with) refuses a delivery. Throwing, or answering with nothing, admits: a
 * shared gate having a bad minute must not become an outbound outage. */

 * - Aggregate per instance: `maxKeys * capacity` admitted deliveries in a burst

 *   defaults. This is a bound, not an estimate: a bucket is dropped only once
 *   refilled to full, so no allowance is ever handed back by churning
 *   destinations.
 * - In REQUESTS rather than deliveries, which is what an outbound path carries:
 *   one admitted delivery may issue up to `retry.attempts` x (`maxRedirects` +
 *   1) HTTP requests - 18 on the delivery defaults - so size the path off that
 *   multiple of the figures above, or lower `retry.attempts` / `maxRedirects`.
 * - NOT covered: one endpoint published on several addresses (separate IPv4 and
 *   IPv6 literals, or DNS answers with differing address sets) is several
 *   destinations and gets one allowance each, and a delivery to it spends one
 *   unit at each of its addresses. And the gate is per process, so a cluster
