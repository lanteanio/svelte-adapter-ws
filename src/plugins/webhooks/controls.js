/**
 * A per-DESTINATION token-bucket admission gate for FIRST attempts.
 * `take(destination)` consumes one token, returning `true` when a delivery may
 * start and `false` when the destination is over its allowance; tokens refill
 * continuously at `refillPerSec` up to `capacity`.
 *
 * The key is not a caller-chosen name and not the URL: `deliverWebhook` passes
 * `<address>:<port>` for an address its SSRF gate resolved and pinned the socket
 * to, and calls `take` once for EVERY address in that pin. A per-registration
 * key would hand every extra registration, alias or per-event `url` callback
 * aimed at one endpoint its own full allowance, and keying by URL origin only
 * narrows that, because the caller picks the hostname too: `127.0.0.1:8080`,
 * `localhost:8080`, `localhost.:8080` and any number of wildcard-DNS names are
 * distinct origins that reach one listener. Keying by pinned address collapses
 * all of those onto one bucket, and charging the whole pinned set is what makes
 * the address the socket actually lands on always one of the addresses charged.
 *
 * What that does NOT cover, precisely:
 * - One logical endpoint published on several addresses (separate IPv4 and IPv6
 *   literals, or DNS answers whose address sets differ) is several destinations,
 *   holds one allowance each, and a delivery to it spends one unit at each.
 * - Because the whole set is charged, a caller who controls its own DNS answer
 *   can spend unrelated addresses' allowances without sending them any traffic.
 *   The answer is capped at 32 addresses, so one admitted delivery charges up to
 *   32 buckets while one request goes out. The padded addresses need not be the
 *   caller's own, so this can exhaust a co-tenant's bucket rather than only the
 *   caller's; the cap is the multiplier, and lowering it lowers the exposure.
 * - A redirect hop is NOT charged: the gate is consulted once, at hop zero,
 *   because charging a hop the destination chooses would let any registration
 *   drain a bystander. Up to `maxRedirects` requests per admitted delivery are
 *   therefore unmetered here, though the address checks still run on each hop.
 *
 * What holds without qualification is only this: a request cannot be put on an
 * address at hop zero without spending that address's unit.
 * - A refusal part-way through a multi-address set keeps the units already
 *   spent, so a refused delivery can cost more than it sent, never less.
 * - The gate is per-process, so a cluster multiplies by replica count until a
 *   shared implementation with this interface is injected through the same seam.
 *
 * The aggregate ceiling for the whole instance is `maxKeys * capacity` admitted
 * deliveries in a burst and `maxKeys * refillPerSec` per second sustained -
 * 102,400 and 10,240 on the defaults (a delivery charging several addresses
 * consumes more than one unit, so it can only come out under those). That
 * product is a real bound rather than an estimate, because a destination's
 * bucket is dropped only after it has refilled to full and a key that cannot be
 * given a slot is refused; lower `maxKeys` to lower the aggregate. It bounds
 * admitted DELIVERIES, not HTTP requests: one admitted delivery may issue up to
 * `retry.attempts` x (`maxRedirects` + 1) requests (18 on the delivery
 * defaults), so an outbound path carries that multiple of the figure.
