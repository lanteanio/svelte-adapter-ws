/**
 * Generic outbound-webhook delivery: SSRF-gated, DNS-pinned, HMAC-signed HTTP
 * POST with jittered-exponential retry. Transport-only and framework-free - it
 * takes a per-webhook config plus the `(topic, event, data)` of one event and
 * returns a terminal outcome; it never throws, never reports, and holds no
 * state. The realtime layer wraps it with event fan-out, failure reporting, and
 * dead-letter capture; a future budget/breaker rides the same config object.
 *
 * Every timer and random draw goes through the runtime seam (`runtime/runtime.js`)
 * so a seeded/deterministic harness controls the jittered backoff, and every URL
 * (initial and each redirect hop) is gated by `safe-url`'s `checkUrl` with the
 * connection pinned to the validated address set so a resolved host cannot rebind
 * to a private address after the check.

		// the gate refuses; they are unmetered, not unchecked.
		//
		// A denial is terminal with `attempts:0` and carries
		// WEBHOOK_ADMISSION_DENIED, so a caller requeues instead of dead-lettering,
		// and the breaker stays untouched: nothing reached the network and the
		// endpoint said nothing about its health. Only a definite no from the gate
		// (`false`, or the `0` a Lua-scripted shared backend replies with) refuses
		// a delivery. A throw, or an implementation that answers with nothing at
		// all, admits: a shared backend having a bad minute must not become an
		// outbound outage, and denying on `undefined` would make a single missing
		// return path in a cluster gate exactly that outage.
		//
		// One unit is spent at EVERY address the pin allows the socket to reach,
		// not at one chosen member of the set: which member the connect logic ends
		// up on is not knowable here, and the caller controls both the contents and
		// the order of its own DNS answer, so a single charged member would be an
		// address the caller can point away from the one the request lands on.
		// Charging the whole set costs a multi-address endpoint one unit at each of

/**
 * Run one outbound-webhook delivery and RETURN its terminal outcome. Resolves
 * the payload (a `transform` returning null skips) and the URL through bounded
 * callbacks, attaches a stable idempotency-key header (keyed with the HMAC
 * secret when set, so an outsider who can induce the same publish cannot
 * precompute and replay/suppress it; a plain content hash otherwise) and an
 * optional HMAC signature, then delivers with per-hop SSRF gating + DNS pinning
 * + retry. Never throws; reports nothing - the caller owns reporting and
 * dead-letter capture from the returned outcome.
 *
 * The optional `hooks` inject the delivery controls the single-instance
 * defaults ({@link createWebhookAdmission}, {@link createRetryBudget},
 * {@link createWebhookBreaker}) or a cluster-shared implementation provide:
 * `hooks.breaker` fast-fails an ejected endpoint (an open circuit -> a terminal
 * `attempts:0` outcome, no network touched) and records the terminal result,
 * keyed by `hooks.key`; `hooks.budget` rations retry amplification, also keyed
 * by `hooks.key`; `hooks.admission` rations FIRST attempts and ignores
 * `hooks.key`, keyed instead by `<address>:<port>` for EVERY address the SSRF
 * gate pinned the socket to, so every registration, alias and per-event `url`
 * callback that lands on one address draws on that address's allowance and
 * whichever address the socket ends up on has paid for the request. The cost of
 * that: a host answering with several addresses spends one unit at each of them,
 * so it holds several allowances rather than one. Charging happens for one hop
 * per delivery, after the gate and before any request - a URL the gate rejects
 * costs nothing, and a redirect hop is not charged. Only outcomes that
 * actually reached the network (`attempts > 0`) move the breaker - a pre-network
 * rejection (SSRF block, redirect error, admission denial, bad config) is a
 * configuration or capacity signal, not an endpoint-health one, so it neither
 * ejects nor heals. Omit `hooks` for the unchanged bare delivery.
