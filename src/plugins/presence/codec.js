/**
 * Binary wire codec for the presence plugin.
 *
 * Produces / consumes the `codec payload` that rides inside the framework's
 * `0x03` topic frame (see src/runtime/wire.js for the frame envelope). The payload is
 * `[op:u8][op-args...]`, one op per presence wire event:
 *
 *   STATE      [op][count:varint]({key}{dataJson})*
 *   DIFF       [op][joinCount:varint]({key}{dataJson})*[leaveCount:varint]({key}{dataJson})*
 *   HEARTBEAT  [op][count:varint]({key}{dataJson})*
 *
 * where `{key}` is a length-prefixed UTF-8 user key and `{dataJson}` is a
 * length-prefixed UTF-8 string of `JSON.stringify(data)`. STATE and HEARTBEAT
 * are the same `{ [key]: data }` roster map; they use distinct opcodes so the
 * decoder maps each straight to its event name with no secondary flag.
 *
 * Design notes (why the encoding is shaped this way, recorded so the choices
 * are legible):
 *
 *   - A presence value is the `select()`-ed user data: arbitrary JSON, not a
 *     fixed shape (unlike a cursor's `{x, y}`). A length-prefixed JSON string is
 *     the only on-wire form that round-trips it losslessly, so the win over the
 *     JSON envelope is the `0x03` framing plus the short per-connection topic id
 *     (vs the repeated channel-name string in every JSON frame), not the value
 *     bytes themselves.
 *   - The codec is STATELESS: no per-connection short-id key dictionary. Presence
 *     publishes are infrequent (a diff on join/leave, one heartbeat per interval)
 *     but every state / heartbeat fans the WHOLE roster to every subscriber, so
 *     the encode-once-send-many path (one encode per publish, regardless of
 *     subscriber count) is the right trade. A per-connection dictionary would
 *     re-encode per subscriber to collapse keys that are already short
 *     (`"42"`, `"<instanceId>:42"`, a user id) - a CPU-for-bytes loss at
 *     presence's fan-out, the opposite of the cursor channel's economics. A
 *     dictionary could be added later as an additive `presence.protocol:2` if a
 *     bench ever justifies it, exactly as the cursor wire did.
 *   - A diff's `leaves` carry their data too, not keys-only: the decoded
 *     `{ joins, leaves }` is then byte-for-byte the value the JSON path produced,
 *     so the binary and JSON transports stay a true 1:1 with no field that
 *     silently differs by transport. A leave roster is tiny (usually one key), so
 *     this costs almost nothing on the frame that least matters.
 *
 * The encoder returns `null` for any frame it cannot represent (a non-object
 * roster, or a value that will not JSON-serialize), which tells the framework to
 * send JSON for that one frame, so apps with exotic presence data keep working.
 * The decoder returns `null` on an unknown opcode, an unknown schema version, or
 * a truncated / malformed frame; presence is self-healing (the next
 * diff / heartbeat / state reconciles), so a dropped frame is safe.
