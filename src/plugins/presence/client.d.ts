import type { Readable } from 'svelte/store';

/**
 * Get a reactive store of users present on a topic.
 *
 * Returns a readable Svelte store containing an array of user data objects.
 * The array updates automatically when users join or leave.
 *
 * Defaults to a 90 s `maxAge` sweep: entries that haven't been refreshed
 * by a heartbeat or diff/state inside the window are removed
 * from the local map. The server emits `{userKey: data}` heartbeats
 * every 30 s by default, so still-present users re-appear on the next
 * heartbeat (no flicker). Pass `maxAge: 0` to opt out of the sweep for
 * admin / audit views that want unbounded retention.
 *
 * The sweep and the server heartbeat are one mechanism split across the two
 * sides, so they are set together. A server running `heartbeat: 0` refreshes
 * nothing, and a client still sweeping on the default window empties its
 * roster about 135 s after the last diff even though every user is still
 * connected. Against such a server, `maxAge: 0` is the matching half.
 *
 * You must also subscribe to the topic itself (via `on()`, `crud()`, etc.)
 * for the server's `subscribe` hook to fire and register your presence.
 *
 * @param topic - Topic to track presence on
 * @param options - `maxAge` defaults to 90000 (ms). Pass `0` to disable
 *   the sweep.
 *
 * @example
 * ```svelte
 * <script>
 *   import { on } from 'svelte-adapter-ws/client';
 *   import { presence } from 'svelte-adapter-ws/plugins/presence/client';
 *
 *   const messages = on('room');
 *   const users = presence('room');
 * </script>
 *
 * <aside>
 *   <h3>{$users.length} online</h3>
 *   {#each $users as user (user.id)}
 *     <span>{user.name}</span>
 *   {/each}
 * </aside>
 * ```

 * the topic (subscribed via `on()` / `crud()`, the same requirement as
 * `presence()`); a push from a connection that has not joined is a silent no-op.
