	 * entry the client swept while the user was still present, so live

	 * Pass `0` to disable heartbeats entirely. That is not only a traffic
	 * decision: presence diffs carry no sequence, so the heartbeat is the
	 * only thing that re-establishes a roster mid-session. With `0`, a
	 * missed `join` or `leave` diverges silently until the client rejoins,
	 * and a client still running the default `maxAge` sweep empties its
	 * roster roughly 135 s after the last diff even when nothing was
	 * dropped - the sweep has no counterpart that restores an entry. The
	 * opt-out is complete only when clients also pass `maxAge: 0`;

	 *
	 * @example
	 * ```js
	 * // No heartbeat: pair it with maxAge: 0 on every client, or their
	 * // rosters decay to empty on their own.
