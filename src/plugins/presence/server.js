/**
 * Presence plugin for svelte-adapter-ws.
 *
 * Tracks which users are connected to which topics and provides live
 * presence lists. Handles multi-tab dedup (same user, multiple connections
 * = one presence entry) via a configurable key field.
 *
 * Zero impact on the adapter core - this is a standalone module that
 * uses ws.subscribe(), platform.publish(), and platform.send().
 *
 * MULTI-TENANT NOTE
 * In a single-process deployment running multiple tenants, the plugin's
 * `Map<topic, ...>` state is keyed by the topic name verbatim. Two
 * tenants whose UI happens to share a room name (`'lobby'`, `'support'`,
 * `'chat-1'`) will collide on the SAME map entry: tenant A's roster
 * includes tenant B's members and vice versa. The fix is at the call
 * site - prefix room/topic names with a tenant scope before passing
 * them to `presence.join` / `presence.list`:
 *
 *     presence.join(ws, 'org-' + ctx.user.tenantId + ':lobby', platform);
 *     presence.list('org-' + ctx.user.tenantId + ':lobby');
 *
 * Same recommendation for `groups`, `replay`, and `cursor` plugins.
 * Live.room consumers can lift this into their `topic: (ctx, room) =>
 * 'org-' + ctx.user.tenantId + ':' + room` factory once and forget it.

/**
 * @typedef {Object} PresenceOptions
 * @property {string} [key='id'] - Field in the selected data that uniquely identifies a user.
 *   Used for multi-tab dedup: if two connections share the same key value, they count as one
 *   presence entry. If the field is missing from the data, each connection is tracked separately.
 * @property {(userData: any) => Record<string, any>} [select] - Function to extract the public
 *   presence data from the connection's userData (whatever your `upgrade` handler returned).
 *   Only the selected fields are broadcast to other clients. By default the
 *   projection copies only the configured `key` field, and only when its name
 *   is structurally safe and its value is a string or finite number. Display
 *   names, profiles, transport metadata and every other field require an
 *   explicit `select` allowlist.
 *
 *   The sensitive-name guard applies to the `key` field too, with no exemption: the
 *   resolved dedup key is broadcast as the roster key in every frame, so a
 *   credential-shaped one must not survive. Nominating `key: 'sessionId'`
 *   logs a warning at construction and falls back to per-connection entries
 *   (no multi-tab dedup) rather than publishing the value - dedup on a
 *   non-secret identifier, or pass an explicit `select` if the field really
 *   is one.
 *
 *   Cursor follows the same fail-closed rule, with `id` as its sole default
 *   identity field.
 *   An explicit selector is an application-owned policy override and its
 *   return value is used as-is. Prefer an allowlist such as
 *   `select: (ud) => ({ id: ud.id, name: ud.name })`.
 *
 *   Should return JSON-serializable data (plain objects, arrays, strings, numbers,
 *   booleans, null) since the result is sent over WebSocket.
 * @property {number} [heartbeat=30000] - Interval in milliseconds between heartbeat broadcasts.
 *   The server periodically publishes a `heartbeat` event to all presence topics carrying a
 *   `{userKey: data}` map of every active user. This refreshes each entry's `maxAge` timer on
 *   the client AND re-adds any entry the client swept while the user was still present, so
 *   live users do not flicker out when a `diff` is missed (e.g. transient network
 *   blip, JS thread saturation). Set this to a value shorter than the client's `maxAge`
 *   (default client `maxAge` is 90 s, so 30 s gives a 3x safety margin). Pass `0` to disable
 *   heartbeats entirely - which is not only a traffic decision. Presence diffs carry no
 *   sequence, so nothing else re-establishes a roster mid-session: with `0`, a missed `join`
 *   or `leave` diverges silently until the client rejoins, and against a client still running
 *   the default `maxAge` sweep the roster empties on its own about 135 s after the last diff,
 *   with no dropped frame involved. The opt-out is only complete when clients also pass
 *   `maxAge: 0` to `presence()`; the constructor warns once when it sees `heartbeat: 0`.
 * @property {boolean} [binary=true] - When true (the default), presence frames go
 *   to binary-capable clients as compact `0x03` frames via the presence codec and
 *   to everyone else as the identical JSON frames; fully transparent. Set `false`
 *   to force JSON for every client (e.g. to compare wire sizes, or on a platform
 *   whose `publishWire`/`sendWire` you do not want exercised). The codec is
 *   stateless - a roster frame is encoded once and fanned out to all subscribers.
 * @property {string[]} [transient] - Dynamic field names (set via `update()`)
 *   that are broadcast live but NEVER included in the `state` snapshot or the
 *   heartbeat roster. A (re)joining or swept-then-readded client therefore never
 *   inherits a possibly-stale transient value - a disconnected typer leaves no
 *   stuck indicator. Typical: `['typing', 'selection']`. Identity fields (from
 *   `select`) and durable `update()` fields not listed here ride the snapshot
 *   normally. Default: none (every `update()` field is durable).
 * @property {number} [topicThrottle=16] - Minimum gap in milliseconds between
 *   two diff publishes for a topic. The byte caps bound how much state one user
 *   can retain; this bounds how often it is re-broadcast, which is the other
 *   half of the same amplification. The 16 ms default caps a topic at roughly
 *   60 diff publishes per second and matches the cursor plugin's option of the
 *   same name. Pass `0` to retain the old next-tick-only coalescing.
 * @property {number} [maxFieldsBytes=8192] - Maximum serialized size of one
 *   `update()` fields blob. An over-cap (or unserializable) update is silently
 *   dropped, mirroring the cursor plugin's `maxDataBytes`. Legitimate presence
 *   fields are small (a typing flag, a selection range), so the default is
 *   never reached in practice.
 * @property {number} [maxTotalFieldsBytes=65536] - Cumulative serialized-size
 *   budget for one user's durable `update()` fields on a topic. Durable fields
 *   ride every future `state` snapshot and heartbeat, so the per-frame cap
 *   alone would still let a client accumulate unbounded stored state one small
 *   frame at a time. An update that would exceed the budget is dropped whole
 *   (no partial merge).
 * @property {number} [maxTopicsPerConnection=100] - Maximum presence topics
 *   tracked for one connection. Together with `maxTotalFieldsBytes`, this caps
 *   one connection's retained dynamic-field footprint at about 6.25 MiB by
 *   default instead of allowing the global one-million-topic registry limit to
 *   multiply the per-entry budget. A join beyond the cap is a silent no-op.
 * @property {string[]} [clientUpdateFields] - Allowlist for field names accepted
 *   from wire `presence-update` frames. Unset (the default), client frames may
 *   not add any dynamic fields. Set it to accept only the listed names. Direct
 *   server calls to `update()` retain the reserved-name guard; when this option
 *   is set, the same allowlist also applies to direct calls.

/**

 * @property {(ws: any, topic: string, platform: import('../../index.js').Platform) => void} sync -

 *   Use this for admin dashboards or observers who want to see presence
 *   without being present themselves.
 * @property {(ws: any, topic: string, fields: Record<string, any>, platform: import('../../index.js').Platform) => void} update -
 *   Set dynamic fields on the present user (typing, selection, a lock map), as a
 *   field-level delta: only fields whose value changed are merged into the user
 *   and broadcast in the next `diff` under `updates[key]`. The update applies to
 *   the user (per dedup key), so any of a multi-tab user's connections may call
 *   it. A connection that is not present on the topic is a silent no-op. Fields
 *   named in the `transient` option are broadcast live but excluded from the
 *   snapshot. Server-reserved field names (identity / credential-shaped; see the
 *   `clientUpdateFields` option) are stripped, and the whole update is dropped
 *   when it exceeds `maxFieldsBytes` or the user's `maxTotalFieldsBytes` budget.
 *   No-op if no field actually changed.
 * @property {(topic: string) => Record<string, any>[]} list -
 *   Get the current presence list for a topic. Use in load() functions or API routes.
 *   Each entry is the same shape the `state` snapshot puts on the wire: the
 *   identity from `select` plus the durable `update()` fields, minus anything
 *   named in `transient` - so an SSR render and the client's first WebSocket
 *   snapshot agree. Returns deep copies (via structuredClone) when data is
 *   JSON-serializable. Falls back to shared references for non-cloneable data.
 * @property {(topic: string) => number} count -
 *   Get the number of unique users present on a topic.
 * @property {() => void} clear -
 *   Clear all presence tracking state.
 * @property {{ subscribe: Function, unsubscribe: Function, close: Function }} hooks -
 *   Ready-made WebSocket hooks. subscribe handles join, unsubscribe removes
 *   from a single topic, close removes from all topics.
