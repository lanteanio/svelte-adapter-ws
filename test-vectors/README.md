Machine-checkable companions to the [wire protocol](../PROTOCOL.md). They are
validated in CI by the [repository protocol contract test](https://github.com/lanteanio/svelte-adapter-ws/blob/dev/test/protocol-schema.test.js)
against both the [protocol schema](../protocol.schema.json) and
frames captured from the reference server, so the specification cannot drift
from the shipped wire.

- **`frames.json`** - one canonical example per control frame plus the
  data-event envelope (`frames`), and a set of deliberately invalid frames the
  schema must reject (`invalid`). Each valid entry names the `$defs` definition
  in the [protocol schema](../protocol.schema.json) it validates against.
- **`binary.json`** - a byte-exact `0x03` binary topic frame with its decoded
  fields. Its `topicId` is above 2^32 (a shared-cohort id, PROTOCOL.md section
  6.2) to catch a decoder that uses 32-bit varint shifts.
- **`webtransport-stream.json`** - the section-15 reliable-stream CONNECT
  declarations and a byte-exact five-record transcript (welcome, hello, binary
  `0x03`, and an ambiguous pair). Each record carries the one-byte text/binary
  `kind` between the length prefix and the message bytes (section 15.1), and
  the final two records are the SAME valid-UTF-8 JSON bytes carried once as a
  text data-event and once as an opaque binary application payload - a decoder
  that ignores `kind` reproduces the payloads but cannot tell those two records
  apart, which is exactly what the byte exists to prevent. Its fragment sizes
  split prefixes, kind bytes, and bodies independently of message boundaries;
  its invalid prefixes pin zero, non-canonical, over-limit, and
  past-the-5-byte-cap rejection; and its `invalidRecords` pin the two
  structural checks past the prefix, an unregistered `kind` and an
  invalid-UTF-8 text record. Record size is the receiver's own (section 15.1),
  so the file states the receiver it assumes as `assumedReceiverMessageBytes`
  and marks the one entry whose verdict depends on it with
  `dependsOnReceiverLimit`: a receiver configured higher accepts that record
  instead of refusing it, and both behaviours are conformant.

A third-party implementer can validate captured frames against the
[protocol schema](../protocol.schema.json) with any JSON Schema validator, and replay these
vectors through an encoder/decoder to check conformance.

Return to the [conformance index](../docs/protocol-conformance.md) to choose a
claim class, find the minimal client and reference surfaces, and run the
executable proof. These vectors are examples and rejection fixtures; the
[wire protocol](../PROTOCOL.md) remains normative.
