# The Lantean protocol

The Lantean protocol is the WebSocket wire contract spoken by
`svelte-adapter-ws` and its client (`svelte-adapter-ws/client`). It is the
contract a third-party client - in any language - implements against.
`svelte-adapter-uws` is the reference implementation; `svelte-realtime` is
built on top of it and speaks the same wire. The name is implementation-neutral
on purpose: four surfaces speak this protocol (the uWS production runtime, the
Vite dev server, the in-process test handler, and the deterministic simulator),
and a third party may add more, so the contract is named for itself, not for
one package.
WebSocket is the protocol's canonical transport and the one every section
assumes unless it says otherwise. Section 14 additionally binds the
client-driven relay of sections 3.10/6.6 to WebTransport QUIC datagrams.
Section 15 binds the reliable protocol to one WebTransport bidirectional
stream. A single WebTransport session may use either binding or both; both
reuse the inner frames frozen here rather than defining transport-specific
copies.

**Transport status (reference runtime):**
WebSocket/WSS is the permanent default and complete transport for the
JavaScript adapter; no capability of this protocol requires sections 14 or 15
to be available. Those sections define how this same wire binds to
WebTransport for a runtime that implements them. Whether and when any package
ships such a lane is a roadmap decision recorded with that package, not a
statement of this contract. A native runtime may implement those bindings
independently - section 14 as frozen, section 15 at its own wire status (see
Meta) - and that does not create a JavaScript server or client deliverable.

The reference implementation is [src/client.js](./src/client.js) (client) and
[src/runtime/wire.js](./src/runtime/wire.js) plus
[src/runtime/handler.js](./src/runtime/handler.js) (server);
[src/vite.js](./src/vite.js) (dev) and [src/testing.js](./src/testing.js) (test)
speak the identical wire.

## Meta

- **Canonical location:** `PROTOCOL.md` in the `svelte-adapter-uws` repository.
- **Revision:** 1.
- **Date:** 2026-07-05.
- **Applies to:** `svelte-adapter-uws` 0.6.0 and later, its bundled client, and
  `svelte-realtime` built on it.
- **Status: frozen.** Revision 1 is a backward-compatibility commitment: within
  the 0.6.x line the control-frame shapes, the data-event envelope, the binary
  `0x03` layout, and the capability-token mechanics in this document will not
  change incompatibly. The wire evolves only additively - new optional fields,
  new capability tokens, new schema versions within a token - per section 5 and
  section 10. A change that is not additive ships as revision 2 behind a new
  token and is never a silent reinterpretation of anything frozen here. The
  provisional surface described under Additive additions is the one exception:
  anything outside it is frozen.
- **Additive additions.** A new optional carriage or token that no existing peer
  can observe until it opts in lands inside this revision rather than as a new
  one, and stays provisional until it freezes. **Section 15's wire-status line
  is the single normative status** for the surface below; this list and the
  companion schema's description restate it and move with it. While that line
  reads anything other than frozen an implementer MUST NOT read the commitment
  above as covering any of it. Provisional today (added in 0.6.0-next.91):
  - **section 15** in whole;
  - the exact `lantean-cap` CONNECT query carrier and its registered tokens
    (section 14.7, appendix C.5);
  - the reliable-stream error registry (appendix C.6);
  - and, in otherwise frozen prose, EVERY reference to anything named above.
    This is a rule, not a list: the references include the transport-status
    preamble, 14.1's reliable-session sentences, 14.2's `hello` note, 14.4's
    stream reservation and its `lantean.reliable:1` MUST NOT, 14.6's
    negotiation bullet, 14.5's closing sentence, section 13's reliable-stream
    claimant paragraph, and the section 15 rows and bullets of appendices D, E
    and F. Those references describe provisional constructs, so they move when
    the constructs do, and a third party MUST NOT read one as frozen merely
    because the section around it is. Section 14's datagram carriage, its frame
    shapes, and its posture of declaring capabilities in the CONNECT query are
    frozen; only the spelling of that carrier can still move.
- **Errata:** corrections that document shipped behavior more accurately (never a
  wire change) land as editorial updates to this revision; report them on the
  repository issue tracker. A wire change lands as a new revision.
- **License:** this document may be reproduced, in whole or in part (including
  its frame tables), to implement or describe the protocol.

The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, MAY, and
OPTIONAL in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
(RFC 2119, RFC 8174) when, and only when, they appear in all capitals. Prose
that describes the reference implementation without these keywords is
descriptive, not a conformance requirement.

## 1. Framing and demux

A connection carries three kinds of WebSocket frame, demuxed by the framework
before any application code runs:

- **Text frame, JSON object with a `type` field** - a *control frame* (section 3).
- **Text frame, JSON object with `topic` + `event`** - a *data-event* frame
  (section 4). It has no `type` field.
- **Binary frame, leading byte `0x03`** - a *binary payload frame* (section 6).
  Server to client it is a *binary topic payload* (sections 6.1-6.4); client to
  server it is a *binary ingress payload* (section 6.5), and ONLY when the
  `wire.ingress:1` capability was negotiated. Leading bytes `0x00`-`0x02` are
  reserved for the `svelte-realtime` layer (binary RPC and uploads); see the
  binary leading-byte registry (appendix C.3).

JSON is the default for everything. The binary `0x03` frame is the only non-JSON
shape, and it is opt-in per connection (section 5). A client that speaks only
JSON is a complete, correct client.

All multi-byte text frames are UTF-8.

### 1.1 Control-frame recognition is by byte prefix (normative for c->s)

The server recognizes a client-to-server control frame by a hot-path byte check,
not by parsing: a text frame is treated as a control frame only when it is under
the control-frame size ceiling (section 1.2) AND its 4th byte (index 3) is `y`
(`0x79`) - i.e. the frame begins exactly `{"type`. Only then is it JSON-parsed.

A consequence a third-party client MUST honour: **client-to-server control
frames MUST be serialized as compact JSON with `"type"` as the first key, with
no leading whitespace and nothing before `type`.** A frame such as
`{ "type": "subscribe" }` (leading space), `{"ref":1,"type":"subscribe"}` (a key
before `type`), or a pretty-printed frame does not begin `{"type`, so the server
does not recognize it as a control frame: it is delivered to the application
message handler as opaque data, with no ack and no error. The reference client
always emits compact, `type`-first control frames. Server-to-client frames carry
no such constraint - the reference client full-parses every inbound text frame,
so key order in a server frame is free.

Data-event frames (`{"topic`, byte[3] = `o`) are not control frames and are
never subject to this check; they are identified after parsing by the presence
of `topic` + `event` (section 4) and MAY appear in either direction.

### 1.2 Control-frame size ceiling (normative)

A client-to-server control frame is recognized as a control frame only while its
total size is **under 8192 bytes**. A client MUST keep every control frame under
this limit. In particular a client MUST chunk `subscribe-batch` (its `topics`
array plus any `recover` map, section 3.2) so each frame stays below 8192 bytes,
rather than relying on the 256-topic cap alone; the reference client chunks at
8000 bytes and 200 topics for headroom.

A control-SHAPED text frame (it begins `{"type`) that reaches or exceeds 8192
bytes is rejected: the server replies with an `error` control frame
(`{"type":"error","code":"CONTROL_FRAME_TOO_LARGE","limit":8192}`, section 3.7)
and does not act on the oversized frame. This turns what would otherwise be a
silent loss into a signal. A `reply` frame (section 3.3) is a control frame and
so is subject to this ceiling: a large reply payload MUST NOT be sent as a
`reply` control frame - use the application-layer binary RPC that `svelte-realtime`
provides for large request/reply payloads. A large text frame that is NOT
control-shaped (a data-event `{"topic`, or any other application text) is not
rejected by this ceiling; it is bounded only by the transport limit (section 1.3).

### 1.3 Transport limits and liveness

- **Inbound frame size.** The server enforces `maxPayloadLength` (default 1 MiB,
  deployment-configurable). A WebSocket frame larger than this causes a
  protocol-level connection close. A server MUST NOT assume application frames
  larger than its configured limit ever arrive intact.
- **Outbound frame size (the client's own inbound cap).** The reference client
  SILENTLY DROPS any server-to-client text or binary WebSocket message larger
  than 1 MiB, in either encoding, with no wire signal. A server therefore
  SHOULD NOT publish a single envelope larger than 1 MiB to a browser client;
  oversized state SHOULD be chunked or moved to a binary codec.
- **Liveness.** The server relies on the WebSocket transport's own keepalive: it
  sends protocol-level pings automatically (default idle timeout 120 seconds) and
  closes an idle connection. A client only needs standard WebSocket pong behavior
  (automatic in browsers). There is no application-level JSON heartbeat frame; a
  third-party client MUST NOT invent one.

### 1.4 Unknown frames

- **Unknown control `type` (section 3, appendix C.1).** A peer that receives a
  control frame whose `type` it does not recognize MUST NOT error. The server
  forwards an unrecognized (but parsed) control frame to the application message
  handler; the reference client ignores an unrecognized server `type`. This is
  the frame-level half of the forward-compatibility rule (section 10): a future
  control type is safe to introduce because existing peers pass it through or
  ignore it.
- **Unknown binary leading byte, by direction.** Client to server: a binary
  frame whose leading byte is not a recognized tag reaches the application
  message handler untouched (it is application payload). Server to client: the
  reference client DROPS any binary frame that is not a well-formed `0x03` frame
  for a known topic id - server-originated binary never falls through to the app
  surface.

---

## 2. Connection lifecycle

1. The client opens the WebSocket. The server immediately sends `welcome` with a
   session id.
2. The client MAY send `hello` to advertise capabilities (section 5). A client
   that never sends `hello` gets the zero-feature JSON path - the
   backward-compatible default, always correct.
3. The client subscribes to topics (`subscribe` / `subscribe-batch`), each
   acknowledged by `subscribed` or `subscribe-denied` (unless the request is in
   the silent mode, section 3.2).
4. Data flows as data-event frames (and, for capability-negotiated topics, as
   `0x03` binary frames).
5. On reconnect the client recovers missed events per topic instead of
   cold-starting (section 7).

Capabilities and the per-connection binary id space are connection-scoped: a
reconnect is a fresh connection that re-advertises `hello` and re-learns any
`wire-id`.

---

## 3. Control frames

Direction key: `[c->s]` client to server, `[s->c]` server to client, `[both]`
either direction.

### 3.1 Connection and capability

| Frame | Dir | Shape |
|---|---|---|
| `welcome` | s->c | `{"type":"welcome","sessionId":"<uuid>"}` |
| `hello` | c->s | `{"type":"hello","caps":["batch","lease", ...]}` |
| `lease-ok` | s->c | `{"type":"lease-ok"}` |

`welcome` is sent once, unprompted, as the first server frame. It carries only
the session id (used by `resume`). `hello` advertises the client's decodable
capabilities (section 5); it is OPTIONAL. `lease-ok` confirms the server will
honour credit-based flow control for a client that advertised `lease`.

A re-sent `hello` REPLACES the connection's capability set (it is not merged);
this supports a lazily-loaded plugin re-advertising an extended set. Two effects
are decided once and are NOT re-evaluated by a later `hello`: credit-based flow
control is armed only by the first `hello` that carries `lease`, and a stateful
binary codec's attach decision (which schema version this connection negotiated)
is fixed for the life of the connection. Both reset only on reconnect.

Parsing is lenient by construction: a `hello` whose `caps` is not an array is
ignored entirely (the capability set is unchanged), and non-string entries
inside the array are skipped. Unknown tokens are recorded but gate nothing, so
advertising a token the server does not know is harmless.

### 3.2 Subscription

| Frame | Dir | Shape |
|---|---|---|
| `subscribe` | c->s | `{"type":"subscribe","topic":"<string>","ref":<int\|string>,"recover"?:{"offset":<int>,"epoch"?:<int>}}` |
| `subscribe-batch` | c->s | `{"type":"subscribe-batch","topics":["<string>", ...],"ref":<int\|string>,"recover"?:{"<topic>":{"offset":<int>,"epoch"?:<int>}}}` |
| `unsubscribe` | c->s | `{"type":"unsubscribe","topic":"<string>"}` |
| `subscribed` | s->c | `{"type":"subscribed","topic":"<string>","ref":<int\|string>,"epoch":<int>}` |
| `subscribe-denied` | s->c | `{"type":"subscribe-denied","topic":"<string>","ref":<int\|string>,"reason":"<string>"}` |

- `ref` is a client-allocated correlation id (a per-connection incrementing
  integer in the reference client; a string is also accepted). The server echoes
  it on the matching ack and never mints its own. **Silent mode:** a request
  whose `ref` is absent, or is not a number or string (null, boolean, object),
  is performed but NOT acked - the server sends no `subscribed` and no
  `subscribe-denied`. An emitted ack therefore always carries a number or string
  `ref`, never `null`. One exception, and it is not an ack: a `subscribe`
  carrying `recover` against a server with a resume hook is REFUSED rather than
  performed silently, with `{"type":"error","code":"RECOVER_REQUIRES_REF"}`
  (section 3.7). Silent mode trades away hearing the outcome; it cannot trade
  away history the client asked to be sent, because a client that never learns
  the gap-fill did not happen resumes over a hole in its own stream.
- `subscribe-batch` caps at **256 topics per frame** and emits one
  `subscribed` / `subscribe-denied` ack per topic, all sharing the one `ref`.
  Topics past the cap are NOT subscribed and are each answered
  `subscribe-denied` with reason `BATCH_OVERFLOW` (under the silent-mode rule
  above: a ref-less batch stays silent) - never dropped without a signal. A
  client MUST NOT exceed the cap; it SHOULD chunk instead. (The reference
  client chunks well below this, at 8000 bytes and 200 topics, to respect the
  control-frame ceiling of section 1.2.)
- `unsubscribe` carries no `ref` and is not acked; the server drops the
  subscription silently.
- A duplicate `subscribe` to a topic already subscribed is acked idempotently
  with the same `subscribed` shape (no double-count). Any authorization gate
  (below) re-runs on the duplicate, so a topic whose authorization has since been
  revoked MAY answer `subscribe-denied` instead.
- `epoch` on `subscribed` is the topic's sequence-space generation (section 7).
- `reason` on `subscribe-denied` is a string. See section 3.2.2 for the
  framework-minted reasons and the application namespace.
- `recover` is resume-on-subscribe (section 7). On `subscribe` it is a single
  `{offset, epoch?}`; on `subscribe-batch` it is a map keyed by topic, so
  recovery for many topics rides the same already-chunked batch instead of a
  separate whole-session `resume` frame that would overflow the control-frame
  ceiling. For each recover-tagged topic the server gap-fills the missed tail
  ahead of the first live frame, exactly as the `resume` frame does, and omits it
  for a topic the auth gate denied. A client that omits `recover` (or a server
  that does not implement it) is byte-identical to a plain subscribe.

#### 3.2.1 Topic names (normative)

A topic is a string. The server accepts a `subscribe` topic only when all of the
following hold; otherwise it answers `subscribe-denied` with reason
`INVALID_TOPIC`:

- non-empty, and at most **256 characters**;
- no character below `0x20` (control characters);
- no `"` (`0x22`) and no `\` (`0x5C`);
- no character above `0x7E` UNLESS the server enabled the `allowNonAsciiTopics`
  option (default off) - so by default topics are printable ASCII.

Independently, a wire `subscribe` to a topic beginning with `__` (two
underscores) is denied `INVALID_TOPIC` UNLESS the server enabled the
`allowSystemTopicSubscribe` option (default off). The `__` prefix is reserved for
framework channels (appendix C.2, e.g. `__replay:`, `__presence:`, `__signal:`)
that MUST NOT be client-subscribable by default. Both options are
deployment-dependent: a third-party client MUST NOT assume either is enabled and
SHOULD treat an `INVALID_TOPIC` on a `__`-prefixed or non-ASCII topic as expected.

#### 3.2.2 Denial reasons

`reason` on `subscribe-denied` is an open-ended string, but the FRAMEWORK itself
mints exactly these:

| Reason | When |
|---|---|
| `INVALID_TOPIC` | The topic failed section 3.2.1, or a default-reserved `__` topic. |
| `RATE_LIMITED` | The connection's subscription cap was reached. |
| `BATCH_OVERFLOW` | The topic sat past the 256-topic `subscribe-batch` cap (section 3.2) and was never subscribed. |
| `FORBIDDEN` | An application authorization gate returned `false`. |
| `INTERNAL_ERROR` | An application authorization gate threw or rejected (fail-closed). |

`UNAUTHENTICATED` is a recognized convention for an application gate to return,
but the framework does not mint or enforce it. An application authorization gate
MAY return any other string, which the server passes through verbatim as
`reason`. A client SHOULD treat an unrecognized `reason` as a denial it cannot
retry blindly.

### 3.3 Data and correlation

| Frame | Dir | Shape |
|---|---|---|
| `batch` | s->c | `{"type":"batch","events":[<data-event>, ...]}` |
| `request` | s->c | `{"type":"request","ref":<int\|string>,"event":"<string>","data":<any\|null>}` |
| `reply` | c->s | `{"type":"reply","ref":<int\|string>,"data":<any\|null>}` or `{"type":"reply","ref":<int\|string>,"error":"<string>"}` |

- `batch` carries N data-event envelopes (section 4) in one frame; it is sent
  only to a client that advertised the `batch` capability. A client decodes it by
  dispatching each element as if it had arrived on its own. Batched events never
  carry `j` (section 4): they are envelopes produced without a jitter window.
- `request` is a server-initiated round-trip: the client answers with `reply`
  carrying the same `ref`. A `reply` with a string `error` field is a rejection;
  otherwise `data` is the result. The server times the pending request out
  (default 5000 ms). `reply` is a control frame and is bounded by the
  control-frame ceiling (section 1.2); for a large reply payload use the
  application-layer binary RPC rather than a `reply` control frame.

### 3.4 Binary topic-id announce

| Frame | Dir | Shape |
|---|---|---|
| `wire-id` | s->c | `{"type":"wire-id","topic":"<string>","id":<int>}` |

Binds a numeric `id` to a topic name so the client can resolve an inbound `0x03`
frame (which carries only the numeric id). See section 6.

### 3.5 Resume

| Frame | Dir | Shape |
|---|---|---|
| `resume` | c->s | `{"type":"resume","sessionId":"<uuid>","lastSeenSeqs":{"<topic>":<int>},"lastSeenEpochs"?:{"<topic>":<int>}}` |
| `resumed` | s->c | `{"type":"resumed"}` |

See section 7. Resume-on-subscribe (`recover`, section 3.2) is the reference
client's mechanism; the whole-session `resume` frame is retained for compatibility.

### 3.6 Flow control (optional)

| Frame | Dir | Shape |
|---|---|---|
| `lease` | s->c | `{"type":"lease","count":<int>,"ttlMs":<int>}` |
| `request-n` | c->s | `{"type":"request-n","n":<int>,"queued"?:<int>}` |

Credit-based backpressure, active only when the client advertised the `lease`
capability. The server grants a window (`lease`); the client replenishes
(`request-n`); the server re-grants. **The server sizes each grant from its own
pressure posture and MAY ignore `request-n`'s `n`**: `n` is advisory, and a
client MUST NOT build credit math that assumes the next grant equals the `n` it
sent. A client that does not advertise `lease` never sees these frames and is
never flow-controlled at the protocol layer.

`queued` is the sender's permit-starved backlog at request time: how many
sends are waiting because the current window is spent or expired. It is an
optional additive field (section 10): a client with no backlog SHOULD omit it,
an absent or zero field claims no backlog, and a peer that predates the field
ignores it. It is advisory and untrusted - a server MAY fold it into its own
pressure accounting but MUST clamp any use of the value to its own bounds, and
MUST NOT require the field for any grant decision, so a client that never
sends it remains fully flow-controlled.

### 3.7 Errors

| Frame | Dir | Shape |
|---|---|---|
| `error` | s->c | `{"type":"error","code":"<string>","limit"?:<int>,"size"?:<int>,"topic"?:<string\|null>}` |

A protocol-level error the server surfaces to the client (never to the
application). Revision 1 defines these `code` values:

- `CONTROL_FRAME_TOO_LARGE` - a control-shaped frame the client sent reached or
  exceeded the control-frame ceiling (section 1.2) and was rejected, not acted
  on. `limit` is the ceiling in bytes (8192); `size` is the offending frame's
  byte length. The frame was rejected WITHOUT being parsed, so no `ref` or
  `type` can be echoed - the size is the handle a developer has on which frame
  overflowed. The client SHOULD reduce the frame (chunk a batch, move a large
  payload off the control path) and MAY surface the error to a developer.

- `RECOVER_REQUIRES_REF` - a `subscribe` carrying `recover` arrived without a
  `ref` while the server has a resume hook. `topic` names the topic, or is
  `null` when a whole `subscribe-batch` frame is refused. History is the one
  reply a client must correlate, so the silent-mode rule of section 3.2 cannot
  apply to it: staying silent would leave the client believing it had
  subscribed AND been gap-filled, and resuming over a hole in its history. The
  subscription is NOT installed. The client MUST send a `ref` on any subscribe
  that asks for recovery.

A server bounds the bytes of control frames it will send one connection per
unit of time - every frame in this section is an answer the client asked for, so
the channel amplifies - and a connection that exhausts that bound is CLOSED with
WebSocket close code `4429`, with no `error` frame before it. A client SHOULD
treat `4429` as throttling: reconnect on a slower schedule rather than treat it
as terminal, and stop whatever was driving the control traffic. The bundled
client does exactly this. `4429` is a close code, not an `error` code, so it is
not in the registry below and adds nothing to any frame.

The `code` set is a registry (appendix C.4): a client MUST ignore an `error`
frame whose `code` it does not recognize (per section 1.4). Codes are additive
within a revision - a new one does not change any existing frame's shape, and
the ignore rule is what makes adding one safe.

### 3.8 Binary ingress (optional)

| Frame | Dir | Shape |
|---|---|---|
| `ingress-ok` | s->c | `{"type":"ingress-ok"}` |
| `ingress-bind` | c->s | `{"type":"ingress-bind","id":<int>,"kind":"<string>","target":<any>}` |
| `ingress-bound` | s->c | `{"type":"ingress-bound","id":<int>}` |

Negotiation for client-to-server binary payload frames (section 6.5), active only
when the client advertised the `wire.ingress:1` capability. `ingress-ok` confirms
the server understands ingress (mirror of `lease-ok`). The client then binds a
client-allocated numeric `id` to a decode-and-route destination: `kind` selects a
server-registered ingress handler, `target` is opaque data that handler
interprets. The server acks a successful bind with `ingress-bound`; the client
MUST NOT send `0x03` ingress frames for an `id` before its `ingress-bound` ack.

A server that does not know the `kind` sends no ack (and no rejection), and the
client keeps that destination on its JSON path - a message is never silently
lost. The silence is deliberate, not an oversight: ingress handlers register
lazily on the server (a destination's handler may not exist yet when the bind
arrives), so "unknown kind" is routinely a TRANSIENT state, and a rejection
frame would force clients to distinguish transient from permanent. Instead the
client MAY re-send the same `ingress-bind` when it has reason to believe the
server is ready (the reference client re-announces after an application-level
round-trip on the same destination); a bind that arrives after the handler
registered acks normally. An unanswered bind therefore costs nothing but the
JSON fallback it would have used anyway. Ingress ids are connection-scoped and
re-announced on reconnect (like `wire-id`, reversed).

### 3.9 Drain / reconnect advisory

A server that is draining or restarting MAY send

```json
{"type":"reconnect","windowMs":<int>,"afterMs"?:<int>}
```

to a connection immediately before it closes it (a graceful `1001`). The client
rolls its OWN reconnect delay, uniform in `[afterMs, afterMs + windowMs)`, and
reconnects on that schedule instead of its normal backoff - so the clients of a
draining node scatter across the window rather than all reconnecting in one
backoff-interval burst and stampeding the replacement. `windowMs` (> 0) is the
dispersal width; `afterMs` (>= 0, default 0) is a floor that holds clients off
entirely while the replacement warms.

This reuses the de-herd design of the data-event `j` field (section 4, Appendix
D): the server advertises the WINDOW, never a pre-rolled offset, so every client
rolls independently. The frame is additive and unknown-type-safe (sections 1.4
and 10) - a client that predates it ignores the unknown `type` and falls back to
normal backoff, so it carries no capability token and the protocol revision is
unchanged. It is advisory only: the client arms the dispersed reconnect when the
close actually arrives, and discards the advisory if the close never comes or a
terminal `4401` / `1008` arrives first.

### 3.10 Client-driven relay (the `game` lane)

The core protocol lets the SERVER publish to a topic (section 4); the `game` lane
lets an AUTHORIZED CLIENT publish to the one room it was granted, with the server
stamping the ordering seq and fanning out to the room. It is the wire for a
real-time session where every participant emits input (a game, a shared
simulation) rather than one server-side author.

| Frame | Dir | Shape |
|---|---|---|
| `game` | c->s | `{"type":"game","event":"<string>","data":<any>,"id"?:<int\|string>}` |
| `game-denied` | s->c | `{"type":"game-denied","reason":"<string>","id"?:<int\|string>}` |

- The `game` frame carries **no topic**. The server derives the destination from
  the connection's *publish grant* - a single topic bound server-side (typically
  at join, once the connection is authorized for the room). A client therefore
  cannot publish to a room it was not granted, and cannot spoof a topic. A
  connection holds at most one grant (one room per socket); binding a second topic
  replaces the first.
- `event` is a string; `data` is any JSON value (or `null`); `id` is an OPTIONAL
  client-chosen input id (a number or string) the client attaches to correlate
  the server's fan-out back to its own local prediction.
- On a valid granted frame the server stamps a monotonic per-room `seq` (the
  session-home sequencer, section 7) and fans the frame out to the room's other
  subscribers as an ordinary **data-event** (section 4):
  `{"topic":"<grant>","event":"<string>","data":<any>,"seq":<int>,"id"?:<...>}`.
  The `id` is echoed only when the sender supplied one. The **sender is excluded**
  from the fan-out (echo suppression): it already holds its own input and predicts
  locally, so re-delivering its own frame would be redundant. A receiver reads
  `id` (when present) to reconcile a frame it can attribute; `seq` is the room's
  authoritative order.
- On a frame the server will not relay it answers the SENDER with `game-denied`
  and relays nothing. `reason` is one of:

  | Reason | When |
  |---|---|
  | `FORBIDDEN` | The connection holds no publish grant (never granted, or revoked). |
  | `INVALID` | The connection is granted but the frame was malformed (a non-string `event`). |

  The frame's `id` is echoed on `game-denied` when present, so a client can tie
  the rejection to the input it sent. A well-behaved client stops sending `game`
  frames after a `FORBIDDEN` until it re-joins.
- The lane is additive and unknown-type-safe (sections 1.4, 10): a server that
  predates it treats `game` as an unknown control type and hands it to the
  application message handler (a JSON data-event of the app's own making), so the
  frame carries no capability token. The seq semantics are the oracle; a
  0x03 binary twin (section 6.6) carries the same semantics compact-encoded.
- The grant is a SERVER-SIDE primitive (`platform.grantPublish(ws, topic)` /
  `revokePublish` / `publishGrant`), the trusted dual of the subscribe
  authorization of section 3.2. There is no client frame to request a grant: a
  client publishes only to a room the application already bound for it.
- The reference JS adapter's in-memory sequencer is a **single-home** authority.
  It permits this lane in a clustered process only when exactly one I/O worker
  owns sockets (additional compute workers are harmless). With multiple I/O
  workers it refuses server grants/publishes and answers client frames
  `game-denied` / `FORBIDDEN`, rather than weakening the room-sequence promise
  or silently omitting subscribers on sibling workers. A multi-home deployment
  must place an external authoritative room sequencer ahead of this primitive.

### 3.11 Established-message overload

| Frame | Dir | Shape |
|---|---|---|
| `message-overloaded` | s->c | `{"type":"message-overloaded","reason":"<reason>","scope":"connection"|"global","retryAfterMs"?:<int>}` |

When server-side established-message admission refuses an application message,
the server sends `message-overloaded` and keeps the connection open. The refused
message was **not** handled and is not retained for a later retry. `reason` is
one of `rate_limit`, `concurrency_limit`, or `queue_full`; `scope` identifies
whether the connection-local or worker-global limit bound the decision.
`retryAfterMs` is present only for `rate_limit` and is a lower bound for another
attempt. Retrying a non-idempotent application message remains the
application's decision.

The gate applies to every server-side application-work lane: frames delegated
to the application `message` hook, client-to-server `0x03` binary ingress
routes, and JSON `game` publishes. Core control frames remain outside it so an
overloaded connection can unsubscribe, request another lease window, or
perform recovery. A concurrency-limited frame may wait only in the configured
bounded queue; once that queue is full, later frames receive `queue_full`
immediately.

---

## 4. The data-event envelope

The carrier for every published event. It has no `type` field - it is identified
by the presence of `topic` + `event`:

```
{"topic":"<string>","event":"<string>","data":<any>,"seq"?:<int>,"j"?:<number>,"id"?:<int|string>}
```

- `data` is any JSON value (or `null`).
- `seq` is the per-topic monotonic sequence number. It is **omitted entirely**
  when the publisher disabled sequencing, so a frame without `seq` is the legacy
  shape and is valid. When present it is load-bearing for resume (section 7) and
  for gap detection.
- `j` is an OPTIONAL de-herd window in milliseconds: a hint that the client
  SHOULD stagger its reaction to this event by a random delay in `[0, j)` to
  avoid a thundering herd. It is a number (floats are legal), not necessarily an
  integer. A client that ignores `j` is correct, just un-jittered.
- A client MAY additionally observe a reconstructed `t` field (a server
  timestamp) on events delivered through a binary codec; it is informational.
- `id` is an OPTIONAL echo of a client-supplied input id, present only on the
  fan-out of a `game`-lane frame (section 3.10). It is a number or a string, and
  lets a receiver correlate the event to a prediction. Absent on server-authored
  events.

A data-event frame is the one shape that flows in both directions: a
client-originated frame of this shape is delivered to the server's application
message handler.

---

## 5. Capability negotiation

The client advertises a flat array of capability tokens in `hello.caps`. The
server records them for the connection and gates every optional feature on token
presence: a connection that did not advertise a token never receives a frame the
token guards. There is no per-topic negotiation and no server-driven downgrade
handshake - capability is connection-level and one-directional (the client
declares what it can decode; the server honours it or falls back to JSON).

The reference client assembles `caps` as `["batch", "lease", "wire.ingress:1",
"game.fanout:1", "relay.resync:1"]` plus every token each registered wire codec
can decode.

### 5.1 Capability registry

Tokens are allocated as `<plugin>.protocol:<n>` (or a bare feature name for the
two core tokens). This table is the registry; a new binary plugin claims a new
token here.

| Token | Binary | schema version | Gates |
|---|---|---|---|
| `batch` | no | n/a | Server may coalesce multiple events into one `batch` frame. |
| `lease` | no | n/a | Credit-based flow control (`lease` / `request-n`, section 3.6). |
| `cursor.protocol:2` | yes | 1 | Binary cursor wire, full-string keys (stateless). The GATING token for the whole cursor family: without it no cursor binary is sent at all. |
| `cursor.protocol:3` | yes | 2 | Binary cursor wire, per-connection short-id dictionary. Effective only alongside `cursor.protocol:2`; advertised alone it has no effect (no cursor binary is sent). |
| `cursor.protocol:4` | yes | 3 | Binary cursor wire, time-stamped short-id dictionary. Effective only alongside `cursor.protocol:2` AND `cursor.protocol:3`; without `:3` it has no effect (the connection falls back to the schema-version-1 full-string encode). |
| `cursor.protocol:5` | yes | 4 | Binary cursor wire, time-stamped short-id dictionary with temporally-streamed positions: each cursor's position is bit-packed against its own previous sample, and the streamed value is the float32-narrowed position, so the decoded value is identical to the schema-version-3 wire's. Effective only alongside `cursor.protocol:2` AND `:3` AND `:4`; without the full ladder the connection stays on its highest complete rung. |
| `presence.protocol:1` | yes | 1 | Binary presence roster wire. |
| `crdt.protocol:1` | yes | 1 | Binary CRDT update wire (opaque bytes; JSON fallback when absent). |
| `smooth.protocol:1` | yes | 1 | Binary smoothed-entity state wire (server to client). |
| `wire.ingress:1` | yes | n/a | Client-to-server binary payload frames (sections 3.8, 6.5). |
| `game.fanout:1` | yes | 1 | Server-to-client compact binary fan-out of the `game` lane (section 6.7); the egress mirror of the `game:1` ingress twin. Independent of `wire.ingress:1`. |
| `relay.resync:1` | no | n/a | Unsolicited `__replay:{topic}` `gap` markers (section 8.1): the server MAY tell this connection, outside any `replay` request or resume, that it proved it lost relayed frames for a topic the connection subscribes. |

Rules:

1. **Per-feature, versioned tokens.** Each binary plugin owns its token and
   versions it independently. A future incompatible schema ships as a new token
   version (for example a hypothetical `presence.protocol:2`); a client that does
   not know it simply never advertises it and keeps the version it knows, or JSON.
2. **The schema version is the fine gate within a token.** It is the second byte
   of every `0x03` frame (section 6). The cursor family shares one gating token
   family but selects its schema version (1, 2, 3, or 4) from the negotiated set,
   so a single connection always sees one cursor schema version on the wire.
3. **A token is never reinterpreted.** Adding a field to a frame an existing token
   already gates is fine (unknown JSON fields are ignored). Changing the meaning
   of an existing field requires a new token version.
4. **Absence is JSON.** Old client, old server, or a missing token all converge on
   the same JSON path.

### 5.2 Not capability tokens

Three mechanisms look like they might be tokens but are not, and a client MUST
NOT advertise them:

- **Resume** (both the `resume` frame and resume-on-subscribe) is not a
  capability. It is always available; a server that predates resume-on-subscribe
  simply ignores the `recover` field and the client degrades to a plain
  resubscribe (section 7).
- **Resume epochs** are not negotiated. They travel as the optional
  `lastSeenEpochs` field of the `resume` frame and the `epoch` field of the
  `subscribed` ack (section 7). There is no `resume.epoch` token.
- **Cursor viewport** culling is not negotiated. The `cursor-viewport` ingress
  frame (section 8) is plain JSON, gated only by topic membership; there is no
  `cursor.viewport` token. Viewport culling is a server-side option, transparent
  to the wire.

---

## 6. The binary topic frame (`0x03`)

A single optional binary frame type carries codec-encoded payloads. It is the
only non-JSON wire shape. In the egress (server-to-client) direction it carries a
capability-negotiated topic payload (sections 6.1-6.4). In the ingress
(client-to-server) direction it carries a bound input payload (section 6.5), and
ONLY when `wire.ingress:1` was negotiated; a client MUST NOT emit a `0x03` frame
otherwise (client-originated binary without an ingress binding is application
payload).

### 6.1 Layout

```
[0x03][schemaVersion:u8][topicId:varint][seq:varint][payload ...]
```

- `0x03` - the demux byte (one octet).
- `schemaVersion` - one unsigned byte; the fine gate within a capability token
  (section 5). A client rejects a version its codec does not implement.
- `topicId` - the numeric topic id (egress) or ingress id (section 6.5),
  announced by a `wire-id` frame (section 3.4, 6.2) at or before the first `0x03`
  frame that uses it. See section 6.2 for the id value range.
- `seq` - the per-topic monotonic sequence number (the same value the JSON
  envelope carries in `seq`). It is `0` in two cases: the publisher disabled
  sequencing for the topic, OR the frame is a single-target send that lies
  outside the topic's sequence space. A client MUST NOT treat a `0` seq as a
  meaningful position.
- `payload` - opaque codec bytes; the framework does not inspect them. Their
  layout is the plugin codec's own contract.

### 6.2 Topic-id binding and id range

A `0x03` frame carries a numeric `topicId`, never a topic name. `topicId` is an
unsigned integer up to 2^53-1. A client MUST decode and store it as such (the
varint decode of section 6.3 uses division, not 32-bit shifts, for this reason):

- **Per-connection ids start at 1.** The server allocates one lazily, on the
  first binary frame it sends for a topic to a given connection, and announces it
  in a `wire-id` frame on the same ordered socket immediately before that first
  binary frame. The binding resets on reconnect.
- **Shared (cohort) fan-out ids are large.** A topic promoted to shared fan-out
  (a cohort of connections receiving one server-encoded frame) announces a
  SERVER-WIDE id allocated from 2^32 upward - so ids at or above 4294967296 occur
  in normal operation. A client that stores topic ids in a 32-bit integer, or
  decodes the varint with 32-bit shifts, WILL break the moment a deployment uses
  a shared codec.

A shared-fan-out `wire-id` is announced at COHORT-JOIN time - at subscribe for
a topic already promoted to shared fan-out, or at the topic's FIRST shared
publish for connections that were already subscribed when the promotion
happened. Either way the announce MAY arrive long before any `0x03` frame for
that topic and MAY never be followed by one. A per-connection `wire-id` is
announced immediately before its first `0x03`. In all cases the announce
arrives at or before the first `0x03` frame that uses the id; a client MUST
record every `wire-id` mapping on arrival.

### 6.3 Primitive encodings (for codec authors)

The framework helpers a plugin codec builds on:

- **varint** - unsigned LEB128: 7 data bits per byte, least-significant byte
  first, continuation bit `0x80` set on every byte but the last. A decoder MUST
  advance the accumulated value by multiplication/division (or 64-bit-safe math),
  NOT a 32-bit shift, so values above 2^32 (section 6.2) round-trip exactly and a
  sequence number is never truncated.
- **f32** - 4-byte big-endian IEEE-754 single precision.
- **f64** - 8-byte big-endian IEEE-754 double precision.
- **str** - a varint byte-length prefix followed by that many UTF-8 bytes (not
  null-terminated).

### 6.4 Backward compatibility and degradation

A topic is sent in `0x03` form only to a connection that advertised the matching
binary token. Any other connection (no `hello`, missing token, or unknown schema
version) receives the JSON data-event envelope for the same topic. The two forms
are interchangeable at the topic level; a deployment can serve binary and JSON
subscribers of the same topic simultaneously.

Binary delivery for a capability MAY cease permanently mid-connection. If a
`wire-id` announce or a stateful binary frame is dropped under backpressure, the
server can no longer trust that connection's decoder state for that capability, so
it degrades that capability to JSON for the rest of the connection (it recovers on
reconnect). Therefore **a client MUST accept the JSON data-event form of any
topic at any time, even after it has received `0x03` frames for that topic.** A
client that treats the first binary frame for a topic as a commitment to binary
will break.

### 6.5 Ingress direction (client -> server)

A connection that advertised `wire.ingress:1` (section 3.8) MAY send the same
`0x03` frame in the client-to-server direction, to move a hot client input path
off the JSON control envelope (and off the per-frame `JSON.parse` it costs). The
layout is identical:

```
[0x03][schemaVersion:u8][ingressId:varint][seq:varint][payload ...]
```

The only reinterpretation is the id slot: it carries a client-allocated *ingress
id*, bound to a destination by an `ingress-bind` frame (section 3.8) and confirmed
by `ingress-bound` before the first `0x03` ingress frame. `schemaVersion` selects
the destination codec's payload revision; `seq` is a per-binding monotonic counter
(`0` allowed); `payload` is the consumer's encoded value, opaque to the framework.

The ingress id space is client-allocated and per-connection (starting at 1), fully
separate from the server-allocated topic-id space of the egress direction, so the
two never collide. On reconnect the client re-announces its bindings from a fresh
`ingress-ok` (the server reset its binding map with the new connection).

Ingress is opt-in and additive: a client that never advertises `wire.ingress:1`,
or a binding the server never acked, uses the equivalent JSON frame - the two are
interchangeable and a deployment can serve both on the same destination.

The first consumer is the smoothed-entity command channel (`smooth.command:1`): a
flush batch of `{id, cmd}` commands encodes as `[count:varint]` then, per command,
`[idDelta:varint][cmd]`, where `cmd` is encoded with the generic compact value
codec (a tagged encoding of the JSON value space - null, boolean, integer as a
zigzag varint, other numbers as f64, string, array, object - matching a
`JSON.stringify`/`JSON.parse` round trip exactly). The decoded batch is identical
to what the JSON path delivers.

### 6.6 Client-driven relay binary twin (the `game` lane)

The `game` lane (section 3.10) has a binary twin: the same semantics
(topic-from-grant, server-stamped seq, sender-excluded fan-out, id echo)
compact-encoded on the `0x03` ingress seam, for a connection that runs its input
path off JSON. It is a NORMAL consumer of the ingress transport of section 6.5,
registered as the ingress kind **`game:1`** - it introduces no new leading byte
and no new framing:

```
[0x03][schemaVersion:u8][ingressId:varint][seq:varint][payload ...]
```

- The client `ingress-bind`s an id to kind `game:1` with **no `target`** (the
  destination topic is the connection's publish grant, resolved server-side, never
  named in the frame - the binary twin preserves the "no client topic" property of
  the JSON lane exactly).
- `schemaVersion` is `1`. `payload` is a SINGLE value-codec value (section 6.3, the
  generic codec the `smooth.command:1` kind also uses, so the ingress seam stays
  one codec table): the array `[event, data]`, or `[event, data, id]` when the
  client supplied an input id. A decoded non-array, or a `game`-with-no-grant, is a
  denial (below), never a crash. The frame's `seq` slot is the per-binding ingress
  counter (section 6.5); the authoritative ROOM seq is the one the server stamps on
  fan-out, as in the JSON lane.
- Decode routes to the same server primitive the JSON lane calls
  (`platform.publishGame(ws, grant, event, data, id)`), so the fan-out is
  byte-identical to the JSON lane's fan-out: the JSON lane is the conformance
  ORACLE and the binary twin produces the identical room delivery.
- A grantless connection, or a non-string `event`, is answered `game-denied`
  (`FORBIDDEN` / `INVALID`) exactly as the JSON lane (the gate is on the grant, not
  the transport). A client uses the JSON `game` frame whenever it has not
  negotiated binary ingress; the two are interchangeable on the same grant.

**Wire status:** frozen and implemented server-side - the reference server decodes
`game:1` and fans out identically to the JSON lane (`test/relay-oracle.test.js`
drives a real `0x03` frame end to end). Binary ingress is opt-in (section 5): a
client that has not negotiated `wire.ingress:1` uses the JSON `game` frame and is
complete and correct. The client-side binary ENCODER lives with the consuming
input channel (as the `smooth.command:1` encoder does), not in the core adapter.

### 6.7 Server-driven relay binary twin (the `game` lane fan-out)

The `game` lane fan-out (section 3.10) has a binary twin, the egress mirror of
the `game:1` ingress twin (section 6.6): the same event delivered to a
subscriber, compact-encoded on the `0x03` topic-payload frame instead of the
JSON data-event envelope (section 4), for a subscriber that runs its receive
path off binary. It is gated by the `game.fanout:1` capability (section 5.1) and
introduces no new leading byte and no new framing:

```
[0x03][schemaVersion:u8][topicId:varint][seq:varint][payload ...]
```

- `schemaVersion` is `1`. `topicId` is the ordinary per-connection wire-id
  binding (section 6.2), announced by a `wire-id` control frame before the first
  `0x03` frame for the topic. Per-connection is exact, not shorthand: this
  fan-out allocates from section 6.2's per-connection range and never announces
  a shared-cohort id for its frames, so the cohort range's availability
  elsewhere in 6.2 does not extend here. The narrowing is invisible to a
  correct decoder, which resolves any `topicId` through the `wire-id` mappings
  it has recorded (6.2) without inspecting the range. `seq` is the
  authoritative ROOM seq the server stamped on fan-out - the same value the
  JSON envelope's `seq` carries - so gap detection is preserved.
- `payload` is a SINGLE value-codec value (section 6.3, the same generic codec
  the `game:1` ingress twin and the `smooth.command:1` kind use): the array
  `[event, data]`, or `[event, data, id]` when the relayed event carries the
  sender's echoed input id. This is the exact byte-inverse of the `game:1`
  ingress payload (section 6.6) - one codec table serves both directions.
- `topic` is never in the payload: it is carried by `topicId` in the header. The
  compact frame encodes exactly the fields the JSON `game` fan-out envelope
  carries (`event`, `data`, optional `id`), and nothing more - no `t`, no `j`
  (the JSON `game` envelope carries neither).
- Fan-out is otherwise identical to the JSON lane: one relay produces one logical
  event, the sender is excluded, and each subscriber receives the event over its
  own negotiated form. A subscriber that has NOT negotiated `game.fanout:1`
  receives the JSON data-event envelope, byte-identical to today. The JSON lane
  is the conformance ORACLE: the compact twin decodes to the identical
  `{event, data, id?}` the JSON subscriber receives, with the identical room
  `seq`.
- Degradation is section 6.4 verbatim: a dropped `wire-id` announce or frame
  poisons the topic to the JSON envelope for the connection's remainder; a client
  MUST accept the JSON envelope for a `game.fanout` topic at any time.

**Wire status:** frozen. The capability is opt-in and additive (section 5): a
subscriber that never advertises `game.fanout:1` receives the JSON `game`
envelope and is complete and correct. `game.fanout:1` is independent of
`wire.ingress:1` - a connection may decode compact fan-out while sending JSON
inputs, or send `game:1` binary inputs while receiving JSON fan-out, in any
combination.

---

## 7. Resume

On reconnect a client recovers missed events instead of cold-starting. The model
is a per-topic `(offset, epoch)` pair:

- **offset** - the per-topic sequence number (`seq`) the client last observed,
  reported per topic (in `subscribe`/`subscribe-batch` `recover`, or in
  `resume.lastSeenSeqs`).
- **epoch** - the sequence-space generation for a topic. The server reports the
  current epoch in the `subscribed` ack; the client tracks it and reports it back
  per topic (in `recover.epoch`, or in the optional `resume.lastSeenEpochs`). An
  epoch is an OPAQUE generation stamp (wall-clock ms in the single-process
  default; backend-defined otherwise). **Epochs compare by EQUALITY ONLY** - a
  client MUST NOT infer ordering from epoch values.

Two mechanisms carry the same `(offset, epoch)` recovery, and both drive the
identical per-topic gap-fill:

- **Resume-on-subscribe (the reference client's mechanism).** Each resubscribed
  topic carries its recovery inline as the `recover` field (section 3.2). The
  recovery is chunked with the resubscribe, so it scales to any subscription
  count under the control-frame ceiling. The reference client uses this and sends
  no separate `resume` frame.
- **The `resume` frame (retained for compatibility).** A single whole-session
  frame carrying every topic's offset/epoch at once. The server still accepts it
  (so an older or third-party client keeps working), but at high subscription
  counts it overflows the control-frame ceiling (section 1.2) and is rejected
  (section 3.7) - which is why resume-on-subscribe is preferred. A silently
  downgraded resume would cold-start every topic with no signal; the explicit
  reject prevents that.

For each recovered topic (by either mechanism) the server compares the client's
reported epoch to the topic's current epoch:

- **Epochs match (or the client reported none)** - the offset is meaningful, and
  the server gap-fills the missed tail from its replay buffer (when the topic is
  recoverable).
- **Epochs differ** - the topic's sequence space was reset or repudiated (a
  restart, a buffer expiry, a shard move, or a confirmed relay loss minted a new
  epoch), so the client's offset belongs to a different counter or points past
  frames it never held. The server does not gap-fill; it cold-rehydrates that
  topic (signalled by a `rehydrate` replay event, section 8).

Resume-on-subscribe is acked per topic by the ordinary `subscribed` frame (the
gap-fill precedes it); the whole-session `resume` frame is acked once with
`resumed`. The epoch is optional in both: a client that has no epoch for a topic
omits it, and the server treats an absent epoch as a match (single-generation
legacy behaviour). Epochs and recovery are additive - a new client against an old
server, or an old client against a new server, degrade to offset-only recovery
(or, for resume-on-subscribe against a server that predates it, to a plain
resubscribe) without breaking.

Some topic classes (cursors, for example) carry `seq` for uniformity and gap
*detection* but are not recoverable: a gap triggers a fresh snapshot, not a
replay. Recoverability is a per-topic property declared by the plugin, not a
property of the frame.

---

## 8. Plugin ingress frames

The bundled collaborative plugins receive a few plain-JSON control frames from
the client. These are plugin contracts layered on the core protocol, listed here
for completeness; an application that does not use a plugin never sees its frames.
Plugin server-to-client output is not a distinct control type - it rides the
data-event envelope (section 4) under reserved `__`-prefixed topics
(appendix C.2), or the `0x03` binary frame when a binary token is negotiated.

| Frame | Dir | Shape |
|---|---|---|
| `cursor` | c->s | `{"type":"cursor","topic":"<string>","data":<any>}` |
| `cursor-snapshot` | c->s | `{"type":"cursor-snapshot","topic":"<string>"}` |
| `cursor-viewport` | c->s | `{"type":"cursor-viewport","topic":"<string>","rect":{"x":<num>,"y":<num>,"w":<num>,"h":<num>,"zoom":<num>}}` |
| `presence-update` | c->s | `{"type":"presence-update","topic":"<string>","fields":{ ... }}` |
| `presence-snapshot` | c->s | `{"type":"presence-snapshot","topic":"<string>"}` |
| `replay` | c->s | `{"type":"replay","topic":"<string>","since":<int>,"reqId"?:<id>}` |

### 8.1 Replay results

`replay` results arrive as data-event frames on the reserved topic
`__replay:{topic}`. Six events can appear; the client dispatches them by
`event`. The `reqId` field echoes the request's `reqId` and is OMITTED when the
request omitted it (a client that always sends `reqId` always sees it back).

| Event | Payload | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `msg` | `{reqId?, seq, event, data}` | One recovered message. |
| `end` | `{reqId?}`, or `{reqId?, truncated:true}` | Terminal: recovery complete. `truncated:true` means the buffer was trimmed past the requested point (in-memory backend inlines truncation here). |
| `truncated` | `null` | Standalone terminal-precursor emitted by some backends before `end` to signal the buffer was trimmed past the requested point. |
| `denied` | `{code, reqId?}` | Terminal: the resume-time subscribe was denied; `code` is the denial reason (section 3.2.2). |
| `rehydrate` | `{epoch}` | Terminal: the reported epoch did not match the topic's current epoch (section 7); the topic must cold-rehydrate. `epoch` is the current generation. |
| `gap` | `{lost}` | Unsolicited, and only on a connection that advertised `relay.resync:1` (section 5.1): the server proved it lost at least `lost` relayed frames for this topic, so the connection's view of it is short and its resume offset can no longer be trusted. `lost` is a lower bound. |

A client SHOULD treat `truncated`, `denied`, `rehydrate`, and `gap` alike:
delivery or recovery did not complete cleanly, so drop the topic's resume
offset and re-snapshot the topic rather than trusting a gap-fill.
Not every backend emits every event: the in-memory backend signals truncation
inline on `end` and never emits `denied` or `rehydrate`; clustered backends emit
the standalone `truncated`, `denied`, and `rehydrate` forms.

`gap` is the one event that arrives outside any `replay` request or resume: a
multi-worker server that detects it lost cluster-relayed frames (section 9's
fan-out is otherwise invisible to a client) MAY push it, at any time, to the
subscribers of the affected topic that opted in - it never carries `reqId`. The
distinction from `truncated`/`rehydrate` matters for the offset: by the time a
relay loss is confirmed, the delivered sequences have already stepped PAST the
lost frames, so a resume from the current offset would silently skip them
forever - which is exactly why the marker exists. The frame MAY carry the `j`
de-herd window of section 4, and a client SHOULD honor it before re-snapshotting
so one gap does not turn a large room into a synchronized stampede. A
connection that did not advertise `relay.resync:1` never receives `gap`
(section 5) and keeps the revision's original silence.

The marker is the immediate half of the answer; the durable half needs no new
wire at all. A server that confirms a relay loss also mints the affected
topic's next epoch (section 7), so an offset taken before the loss and
presented WITH its recorded epoch - by a subscriber that disconnected before
the loss was confirmed, or by a client that never advertised the capability -
fails the ordinary epoch compare at its next resume and cold-rehydrates
instead of gap-filling past the hole. Epochs compare by equality only, so
this is machinery every client already implements; the reference client
always presents its recorded epochs. A client that presents an offset with
no epoch is treated as a match by section 7's own rule, and is the one
resume shape neither half of the signal can repair.

---

## 9. What is not on the wire

The protocol has server-internal machinery that never reaches a client. A client
author can ignore all of it:

- **Cluster fan-out.** In a multi-worker or Redis-clustered deployment the server
  relays publishes between workers/instances and re-encodes binary frames locally
  for each instance's own subscribers. Cohort topic names, the server-wide
  binary-id allocation, the per-process codec registry, and the inter-worker relay
  envelopes are all server-side; a client only ever observes the `wire-id` frame
  and the `0x03` frame defined above, identical whether the deployment is a single
  process or a cluster.
- **Inter-worker / worker-thread messages.** The framework's internal
  `postMessage` frames (publish relays, heartbeats, lifecycle, simulation) are not
  WebSocket frames and are not part of this protocol.

---

## 10. Compatibility and versioning

- Every optional feature is gated by a capability token; a client advertises only
  what it can decode, and the server falls back to JSON otherwise.
- New fields are additive: a peer MUST ignore fields it does not recognise. New
  frame behaviour ships behind a new token (or a new schema version within a
  token), never by reinterpreting an existing field. A new control `type` or a
  new binary leading byte is safe to introduce because existing peers pass it
  through or ignore it (section 1.4).
- There is no wire version number, by design: the capability tokens ARE the
  versioning (appendix D). A client and server negotiate feature by feature.
- A zero-`hello`, JSON-only client is a fully supported first-class client.
- This document is revision 1, frozen for the 0.6.x line (see Meta). The shapes
  above are stable; only additive changes land within revision 1.

---

## 11. Guarantees and non-guarantees

What the protocol PROMISES (a client MAY rely on these):

- `welcome` is the first frame the server sends on a connection.
- Per-topic `seq` is monotonic per connection while the epoch is unchanged.
  A multi-worker reference server enforces this at publish time: an event is
  either unsequenced, or its positive seq and ordered fan-out come from one
  external authority. Independent worker counters and numeric seqs sent through
  the built-in multi-origin relay are refused rather than weakening this promise.
- A `wire-id` for an id arrives at or before the first `0x03` frame that uses
  that id (section 6.2).
- On resume, a topic's gap-fill frames precede its `subscribed` ack (or the
  whole-session `resumed`).
- `subscribe-batch` acks preserve the submission order of `topics` within a batch.
- Delivery of every event for a topic, across a disconnect, is guaranteed ONLY
  when that topic is recoverable AND the client resumes with a matching epoch and
  a valid offset (section 7).

What the protocol does NOT promise (a client MUST NOT assume these):

- **Subscribe acks do not resolve in request order.** An authorization gate is
  asynchronous, so two `subscribe` requests MAY be acked out of order. Correlate
  by `ref`/`topic`, never by arrival order.
- **No cross-topic ordering.** `seq` is per topic; there is no global order across
  topics.
- **No delivery guarantee without resume + a recoverable topic.** A non-recoverable
  topic (for example a cursor stream) fills a gap with a fresh snapshot, not a
  replay.
- **Binary is not a commitment.** A capability MAY revert to JSON mid-connection
  (section 6.4).
- **`request-n` credit is server-sized.** The next grant is not the `n` you sent
  (section 3.6).

---

## 12. Security considerations

- **Reserved-channel isolation.** Client `subscribe` to a `__`-prefixed topic is
  denied by default (section 3.2.1). Framework channels (`__signal:`, `__presence:`,
  `__replay:`, ...) carry control and other users' state; allowing arbitrary
  client subscription to them would be a channel-hijack vector. A deployment
  enables `allowSystemTopicSubscribe` only when it has its own gate.
- **Topic character rules are log-safety.** The control-character and
  quote/backslash bans (section 3.2.1) keep topic names from injecting into logs,
  metrics labels, and JSON. Non-ASCII is off by default so that bidirectional and
  line-separator code points cannot appear in a topic name unless a deployment
  opts in and accepts the responsibility.
- **DoS posture.** The 8192-byte control-frame ceiling (section 1.2) and the
  configured inbound payload limit (section 1.3, default 1 MiB) bound per-frame
  work; an oversized control frame is rejected WITHOUT being parsed. Deployments SHOULD additionally apply
  per-IP upgrade rate limiting and a per-connection subscription cap
  (`RATE_LIMITED`, section 3.2.2).
- **Authorization is fail-closed.** An authorization gate that throws denies with
  `INTERNAL_ERROR` (section 3.2.2); it never falls open.
- **Origin and cookies.** The WebSocket upgrade is subject to the server's origin
  policy; a companion authenticate endpoint exists so a session cookie can be set
  on a plain HTTP response (a `Set-Cookie` on the 101 upgrade is dropped by some
  proxies). These are server-API concerns, not wire frames, but a third-party
  client MUST be prepared for an upgrade to be refused by policy.
- **Compression and secrets.** When permessage-deflate is enabled, mixing
  attacker-influenced and secret data in one compression context is a
  BREACH-class risk; the server gates compression accordingly. An application
  SHOULD NOT place secrets in a topic shared with untrusted subscribers.
- **No PII on the wire by default.** Protocol-level frames carry no personal data;
  an application MUST NOT rely on the framework to redact application payloads.

---

## 13. Conformance classes

A client MAY implement a subset of the protocol and still be a first-class
client. Four cumulative classes let a third party claim precise conformance:

| Class | Implements | Sections |
|---|---|---|
| **Core** | welcome, hello (MAY be empty), subscribe/unsubscribe, data-event dispatch, resume-on-subscribe | 1-4, 7 |
| **Batch** | Core + decodes `batch` (advertises `batch`) | + 3.3 |
| **Flow-controlled** | Batch + honours `lease`/`request-n` (advertises `lease`) | + 3.6 |
| **Binary** | Flow-controlled + decodes `0x03` for one or more binary tokens (advertises them) | + 5, 6 |

A Core client that advertises no capabilities is complete and correct: it
receives every topic as JSON and recovers on reconnect. Each higher class is an
opt-in optimization, never a correctness requirement. A client MUST honour the
requirements of every class at or below the one it claims (for example, a Binary
client MUST still accept the JSON form of any topic, section 6.4).

The classes are labels for common bundles, not the only legal combinations:
capability tokens negotiate independently (section 5), so a client MAY
implement any token subset (binary without `lease`, for example) and remain
fully conformant - it simply claims the highest class whose whole row it
satisfies. The ladder mirrors the reference client's own build-up.

These classes describe the inner reliable protocol. A WebSocket claimant
carries them directly; a WebTransport reliable-stream claimant carries the
same bytes through section 15's record layer and additionally conforms to
section 15. A section-14 datagram-only claimant is not Core: it implements only
the explicitly named `game` lane.

---

## 14. The WebTransport binding (the `game` lane over QUIC datagrams)

WebSocket carries the whole protocol; this section binds exactly ONE lane - the
client-driven relay of sections 3.10 and 6.6 - to a WebTransport session
(RFC 9220 extended CONNECT over HTTP/3, RFC 9297 datagrams). The lane is the
one part of the protocol whose payloads are natively loss-tolerant: an input
stream where the room `seq` already defines the authoritative order and a
stale input is worthless, which is precisely what an unreliable datagram is
for. Everything in this section reuses frames frozen above; the binding
defines carriage, not new wire. The lane's HOME transport remains WebSocket:
sections 3.10 and 6.6 are complete over WebSocket on their own, a deployment
that games over wss uses them unchanged and never needs this section, and
nothing here is required to speak the `game` lane. What the binding adds is a
second carriage - and because the two transports share rooms (14.3), enabling
WebTransport later adds sessions to the same rooms without touching the
WebSocket path.

The reference `svelte-adapter-uws` runtime does not terminate QUIC and does
not implement this binding; it is normative for any runtime that does, and
the JSON lane of section 3.10 - including its committed conformance vectors -
is the behavioral oracle such a runtime's relay output is proved against.

### 14.1 Session establishment

The extended-CONNECT request is this binding's analogue of the WebSocket
upgrade (section 2), and the same trust boundary:

- The application authorizes the session from the CONNECT request - `:path`,
  request headers, and `origin` - exactly as an upgrade guard authorizes a
  WebSocket. The path shape is application-defined; embedding the room key in
  it (for example `/game/<room>`) is RECOMMENDED, since a session is bound to
  one room at accept and the path is the natural place to say which.
- When the datagram `game` lane is requested, accepting the session
  (`:status 200`) binds it, server-side, to exactly ONE room: the session is
  subscribed to that room's fan-out (14.3), and the application MAY also bind
  the publish grant of section 3.10 (a granted session is a *publisher*; an
  ungranted one is a *spectator* - its `game` frames are answered
  `game-denied` `FORBIDDEN`, its fan-out delivery is unaffected). One
  session holds at most one datagram room and one grant. A session that
  declares only the reliable binding of section 15 has no implicit room; its
  memberships come from `subscribe` records on the stream. A non-200 response
  is a refusal and carries no protocol meaning beyond HTTP semantics.
- Closing the session (either end, or QUIC idle timeout) is the analogue of a
  WebSocket close: the datagram subscription and any grant are dropped. The
  datagram membership has no resume; a client re-CONNECTs and re-joins.
  Reliable-topic recovery, when section 15 is also active, is independently
  carried on the new session's new stream (15.5).

### 14.2 Client-to-server datagrams

Section 1's frame demux maps onto the first payload byte of each datagram:

| First byte | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0x03` | The binary relay frame of section 6.6, with the `ingressId` slot carrying `0`. |
| anything else | A UTF-8 JSON control frame; on this binding only `{"type":"game",...}` (section 3.10). |

The binary form is byte-compatible with section 6.6's layout
(`[0x03][schemaVersion:u8][ingressId:varint][seq:varint][payload]`,
`schemaVersion` 1, payload the value-codec array `[event, data]` or
`[event, data, id]`), so one decoder and one set of conformance vectors serve
both transports. The differences are carriage-level only:

- **`ingressId` is `0`.** There is no `hello` or `ingress-bind` on the
  datagram carriage; CONNECT declarations are its only capability carrier.
  A `hello` on a section-15 stream does not alter datagram negotiation. The
  datagram session itself IS the binding (one room, kind `game:1`), and id
  `0` - which the client-allocated WebSocket ingress space of section 6.5
  never uses (it starts at 1) - marks that implicit binding. A datagram with
  any other `ingressId` is dropped.
- **`seq`** is the per-session monotonic counter of section 6.5 (`0` allowed).
  It is diagnostic; the authoritative room order is the seq the server stamps
  on fan-out, exactly as on WebSocket.
- Relay semantics, denial reasons, and `id` echo are those of sections 3.10
  and 6.6, unchanged: the gate is the grant, not the transport. `game-denied`
  travels as a JSON datagram to the sender; it MAY be lost, and that is sound,
  because every further ungranted frame re-fires it - the sender converges on
  the denial.

A client SHOULD prefer the binary form (the JSON form exists so a minimal
client can speak the lane with no encoder at all), and MUST size its inputs to
the session's maximum datagram size - an oversized input cannot be sent as a
datagram and this binding defines no fragmentation.

### 14.3 Server-to-client fan-out

Fan-out to a WebTransport session is one datagram per event, carrying the
UTF-8 bytes of the ordinary data-event envelope of section 4 -
`{"topic":..,"event":..,"data":..,"seq":..,"id"?:..}` - byte-identical to what
a WebSocket subscriber of the same room receives. Consequences, all
intentional:

- **Rooms are transport-agnostic.** A room's subscribers may be WebSocket
  connections and WebTransport sessions in any mix; one relay produces one
  envelope, delivered to each subscriber over its own transport. Sender
  exclusion applies across transports (the sender is excluded whichever
  transport it used).
- **Loss is skipped, never repaired.** Each envelope carries the room `seq`;
  a receiver detects a gap and continues - fresher input supersedes lost
  input. The resume machinery of section 7 does NOT apply to this binding,
  and there is no gap-fill.
- **An envelope that exceeds the session's maximum datagram size is not
  delivered to that session.** The room seq advances regardless (WebSocket
  subscribers still receive the event), so the gap is visible to the session
  like any other loss. Applications running rooms over this binding SHOULD
  keep event payloads comfortably under a conservative path MTU (~1 KB).

A compact binary fan-out form is defined additively in section 14.6 (the
`game.fanout:1` capability, the egress mirror of the section 6.6 / 14.2 ingress
twins). When a session has not negotiated it, the JSON envelope above is the
fan-out shape, byte-identical to what a WebSocket subscriber of the same room
receives.

### 14.4 What does not apply

The datagram carriage carries the `game` lane and nothing else. It carries no
`welcome`, `hello`, `subscribe`, `batch`, `lease`/`request-n`, or
`resume`, and no server-to-client `0x03` topic frames except section 14.6's
compact `game` fan-out. Membership comes from CONNECT acceptance and its
carriage capabilities come only from section 14.7. A combined session may
carry all of those reliable frames on section 15's stream; they never appear
as datagrams.
Liveness is the QUIC transport's own idle/keepalive machinery; the ping
expectations of section 1.3 do not apply. WebTransport STREAMS are reserved:
a session that did not declare `lantean.reliable:1` at CONNECT MUST NOT open
them and a server ignores or closes any that appear. Section 15 is the additive
exception: a declaring session may open exactly one client-initiated
bidirectional stream for the reliable protocol. Unidirectional streams and
additional bidirectional streams remain reserved.

### 14.5 Security considerations

Section 12 applies, with the transport-specific notes: the CONNECT `origin`
header SHOULD be checked exactly as the upgrade origin is on WebSocket; the
publish grant remains a server-side primitive that no frame can request
(sections 3.10, 6.5 notwithstanding, there is no bind handshake to abuse); and
because datagrams are cheap to emit, a server SHOULD rate-limit per-session
ingress the way it rate-limits WebSocket control traffic, and MAY close a
session that persists past denial.

A runtime claiming this datagram binding implements sections 3.10, 6.6, and
this section. The conformance classes of section 13 do not apply to the
datagram-only lane; they do apply independently when the same session also
implements section 15.

### 14.6 Compact fan-out (the `game.fanout:1` datagram carriage)

The compact `game` fan-out of section 6.7 has a WebTransport carriage: the same
value-codec payload, carried on the `0x03` datagram shape. It is the egress
mirror of section 14.2's ingress datagram, and shares its wire form with the
WebSocket carriage (section 6.7) so ONE decoder serves both transports.

```
[0x03][schemaVersion:u8][0][seq:varint][payload ...]
```

- `schemaVersion` is `1`. The id slot is the reserved id `0` = "the session's
  bound room" - the session holds exactly one room (14.1), so no `wire-id`
  announce exists or is needed on this carriage, mirroring 14.2's reservation of
  ingress id `0` in the opposite direction. With id `0` the header is
  byte-layout-identical to the WebSocket `0x03` topic frame (section 6.7) with
  `topicId` `0`, so one client decoder serves both carriages.
- `payload` is byte-identical to the WebSocket carriage: a single value-codec
  value `[event, data]` or `[event, data, id]` (section 6.3). `seq` is the
  authoritative room seq.
- Direction disambiguates the two `0x03` datagram forms: a client-to-server
  `0x03` datagram is the ingress twin (14.2), a server-to-client `0x03` datagram
  is this fan-out; datagrams are directional, so the shapes never meet on one
  decode path.
- Loss semantics are 14.3 verbatim: skipped, never repaired; the header `seq`
  makes the gap visible. A payload that exceeds the session's datagram size is
  not delivered to that session (the room seq advances regardless).
  Applications SHOULD keep compact `game.fanout` payloads under a conservative
  path MTU (~1 KB), noting that the datagram's quarter-stream-ID varint consumes
  budget below this payload.
- **Negotiation.** The session declares compact-decode capability at CONNECT
  using the exact query carrier in section 14.7. A session that does not
  declare `game.fanout:1` receives the JSON envelope datagram (section 14.3),
  preserving the one-directional negotiation posture of section 5.

A runtime MAY implement the WebSocket carriage (section 6.7) without this
datagram carriage, and vice versa: the two are independently negotiated
(`game.fanout:1` in `hello.caps` on WebSocket; the CONNECT query declaration on
WebTransport) and share only the frozen payload and header shape above.

### 14.7 CONNECT capability declarations

WebTransport has no `hello` before CONNECT acceptance, so carriage-level
capabilities use the CONNECT request's query component. The query key is
**`lantean-cap`**, repeated once per token:

```
?lantean-cap=lantean.reliable%3A1&lantean-cap=game.fanout%3A1
```

The server applies normal URL query percent-decoding exactly once, then compares
the decoded value case-sensitively. Repeating the key is the only list form;
comma-separated values are one unknown token. Duplicate known tokens are
idempotent. A malformed or unknown value is ignored and grants no capability.
The registered CONNECT tokens are:

| Token | Gates |
|---|---|
| `game.fanout:1` | Compact server-to-client datagram fan-out (14.6); absence falls back to JSON datagrams. |
| `lantean.reliable:1` | Permission to open the one reliable bidirectional stream defined by section 15. |

CONNECT declarations gate only WebTransport carriage. They do not populate the
reliable lane's `hello.caps`: after the stream opens, `hello` still negotiates
`batch`, `lease`, and binary codec tokens exactly as section 5 specifies.
This separation prevents a CONNECT routing intermediary from silently enabling
an inner codec the endpoint never advertised.

---

## 15. The WebTransport reliable-stream binding

This section binds the reliable Lantean protocol to one long-lived
client-initiated WebTransport bidirectional stream. The stream is an ordered
byte stream, not a message transport, so it adds one record delimiter and one
message-type byte around the unchanged WebSocket message bytes. The same QUIC
connection may
simultaneously carry section 14's unreliable `game` datagrams.

Section 14 remains the datagram binding and section 15 remains the reliable
binding. A runtime may implement either or both. The reference
`svelte-adapter-uws` runtime does not terminate QUIC; this section is
normative for a runtime that claims the binding.

**Wire status: freeze candidate.** The binding is additive within revision 1:
only a session that declares `lantean.reliable:1` may open the stream, while
an older client opens none and an older server keeps section 14.4's
close-or-ignore behavior. The inner frames and their meanings do not change.
A freeze is an explicit revision of this section; an incompatible future
carriage requires a new CONNECT token.

### 15.1 Record framing

Each stream record is:

```
[messageLength:varint][kind:u8][messageBytes:messageLength]
```

- `messageLength` is canonical unsigned LEB128, using the primitive encoding
  of section 6.3. It counts `messageBytes` only; the `kind` byte is carriage
  framing, exactly like the prefix, and is never counted. A canonical encoding is the
  shortest possible encoding; a redundant continuation byte is a protocol
  error. The prefix MUST NOT exceed **5 bytes**, which locally narrows the
  uncapped primitive of section 6.3. A receiver MUST reject a longer one with
  `PROTOCOL_ERROR`, and MAY do so the moment the breach is knowable - a fifth
  byte still carrying the continuation bit already proves it - rather than
  reading a sixth. This bounds the parse before any length is known, which a
  prefix whose width is inferred from a size limit does not. Five groups carry
  35 bits, so **34,359,738,367** is the largest length this carriage can
  express and therefore the ceiling on any limit below.
- **A sender MUST NOT emit a record whose `messageBytes` exceed 1,048,576
  bytes**, unless it knows out of band that its peer accepts more. Nothing on
  this carriage negotiates a size, so this bound is fixed and every sender can
  evaluate it against the record in hand.
- **A receiver's limit is its section 1.3 inbound message limit applied to this
  carriage** - `maxPayloadLength` under another name: deployment-configurable,
  and **1,048,576 bytes** absent configuration. A deployment SHOULD apply one
  value to both carriages whether it raises that limit or lowers it, so that a
  message its WebSocket accepts is not refused on its stream and a message its
  WebSocket refuses is not accepted on its stream. A receiver MUST reject a
  zero length, a declared length above its own limit (immediately on the
  complete prefix, before allocating for that length and without waiting for
  body bytes), or a record whose bytes are incomplete when the peer finishes
  its sending direction. The LENGTH VALUE is judged only once the prefix is
  complete, never on a partial accumulation, which would let the same bytes be
  answered with two different codes.
- The two directions are not symmetric, and this section does not pretend
  otherwise: a client's inbound capacity is a property of its runtime rather
  than a deployment knob, and section 1.3 describes what the reference client
  applies. A sender within the unnegotiated bound may therefore still be
  refused by a peer that accepts less, exactly as on WebSocket. What the
  carriage improves is diagnosis: an over-limit server-to-client message is a
  SILENT drop on WebSocket (section 1.3) but a signalled `RECORD_TOO_LARGE`
  here, so the same mistake is visible instead of invisible.
- `kind` re-supplies the one bit of WebSocket framing a byte stream discards:
  the message type. `0x00` is a text message, `0x01` is a binary message. A
  receiver MUST reject any other value with `PROTOCOL_ERROR`; values
  `0x02`-`0xFF` are reserved and only a future revision may define one. The
  forward-compatibility pass-through of sections 1.4 and 10 deliberately does
  NOT apply to this byte: an unknown frame can be forwarded or ignored, but a
  record whose TYPE is unknown cannot be safely delivered anywhere, so it is a
  structural error, not an extension point. The byte is read only after the
  length verdict of the complete prefix, so a record refused for its length is
  answered for its length and its `kind` byte is never inspected.
- `messageBytes` are EXACTLY the bytes the corresponding WebSocket message
  carries, and `kind` is that message's WebSocket type. No opcode, compression
  marker, checksum, or carriage header is inserted inside `messageBytes`. Demux
  after deframing follows the WebSocket rules unchanged, gated by `kind`
  exactly as they are gated by the opcode there: a text record is subject to
  section 1.1's control-frame recognition and MUST be valid UTF-8 in whole -
  RFC 6455 parity, rejected per 15.6, because two peers that repair invalid
  bytes differently would silently disagree about the record's content - while
  a binary record is subject to the leading-byte registry of appendix C.3 and
  section 1.4's unknown-leading-byte rule, and never to control-frame
  recognition. A control record is therefore a TEXT record beginning exactly
  `{"type`, a binary topic record is a BINARY record beginning `0x03`, and a
  binary record whose bytes happen to be printable JSON stays an application
  binary payload: two records with identical `messageBytes` and different
  `kind` are as distinct here as a text and a binary WebSocket message carrying
  the same bytes, which is what makes the carriage lossless rather than merely
  length-delimited.
- Record boundaries are independent of QUIC read boundaries. A prefix or body
  may arrive across any number of reads, and one read may contain any number of
  complete records plus a partial next record. A receiver MUST parse
  incrementally and MUST NOT treat a read boundary as a message boundary.

The prefix and the `kind` byte are carriage, not an inner frame. Consequently every JSON schema,
`0x03` codec, conformance vector, unknown-frame rule, control-frame recognition
rule (section 1.1), and the 8192-byte control-frame ceiling with its
`CONTROL_FRAME_TOO_LARGE` reply (section 1.2) remain shared with WebSocket after
the prefix and the `kind` byte are removed. Section 1.2's ceiling keeps its
DIRECTION as well as its
value: it bounds CLIENT-TO-SERVER control records only, and a server-to-client
control record - a large `batch` (section 3.3), say - is bounded by the record
limit alone, exactly as on WebSocket. The two limits are independent and answer
differently: a record-limit breach resets the lane, while a client-to-server
control record that reaches section 1.2's ceiling is answered with the ordinary
`error` control frame (section 3.7) on the same stream and leaves the lane open.

### 15.2 Negotiation and topology

The client MUST declare `lantean.reliable:1` using section 14.7 before opening
the stream. After a successful CONNECT response it MAY open exactly **one**
bidirectional stream, and the first client-initiated bidirectional stream is the
reliable lane. The stream is optional: a declaring session may still use only
datagrams.

The server MUST NOT open the reliable stream. A second client-initiated
bidirectional stream, any unidirectional stream, or any stream from a session
that omitted the token is not another protocol lane; the endpoint closes it
with `STREAM_LIMIT` (appendix C.6) and leaves an already-open reliable lane
unchanged. Once the reliable stream closes it cannot be replaced within the
same WebTransport session; recovery opens a new CONNECT session (15.5). This
single-stream topology preserves the ordering guarantees of section 11 and
prevents control, subscription, and data records from acquiring cross-stream
race rules.

### 15.3 Inner protocol lifecycle

Opening the stream creates one logical protocol connection:

1. The server's first stream record MUST be the unchanged `welcome` frame.
2. The client MAY send the unchanged `hello` frame. Inner capabilities are
   negotiated solely by `hello.caps`, not copied from CONNECT declarations.
3. Subscribe, batch, lease/request-n, resume, data-event, and `0x03` records
   then behave exactly as sections 2-11 specify.

The `welcome.sessionId`, capability set, wire-id space, ingress-id space,
subscriptions, leases, and resume state belong to the reliable stream. The
CONNECT-accepted datagram room and publish grant of section 14 belong to the
datagram lane. They are independent:

- a stream `subscribe` neither joins nor leaves the CONNECT datagram room;
- a datagram-room grant does not authorize a stream subscription or ingress
  binding;
- subscribing on the stream to the same room as the datagram lane requests
  both deliveries. The peer MAY observe the same logical room `seq` on both
  carriages and must deduplicate if it wants only one.

There is no cross-carriage ordering. Stream record order is total within the
reliable lane; datagram order and loss remain section 14's. CONNECT acceptance
and datagram membership may precede the first `welcome`, but no reliable
protocol action exists before `welcome`.

### 15.4 Liveness and closure

Liveness uses QUIC/WebTransport idle timeout, keepalive, path validation, and
connection health. The WebSocket ping behavior in section 1.3 does not become an
inner record, and a peer MUST NOT invent a JSON heartbeat.

A FIN or reset in either direction closes the whole logical reliable lane:
both endpoints stop writing it, and the server drops its reliable
subscriptions, leases, ids, and session id exactly as on WebSocket close. It
does **not** close the surrounding WebTransport session or its datagram
membership. Closing the CONNECT session or QUIC connection closes both lanes.
An orderly application shutdown SHOULD finish queued complete records, send
FIN, and then keep the WebTransport session only if its datagram lane remains
useful.

### 15.5 Resume and QUIC migration

QUIC connection migration changes the network path of the SAME connection. It
does not create a new protocol connection, does not emit a new `welcome`, and
does not trigger resume; the open stream and both lane memberships continue.

Recovery applies only after a different WebTransport CONNECT session is
created. The client declares `lantean.reliable:1`, opens its new reliable
stream, receives the new `welcome`, re-sends `hello`, and uses the unchanged
resume-on-subscribe `recover` fields (or compatibility `resume` frame) from
section 7. Offset and epoch comparison is identical to WebSocket. Datagram
`game` membership is re-authorized independently at CONNECT and has no
gap-fill.

### 15.6 Flow control and slow consumers

QUIC stream flow control and section 3.6 leases solve different layers and both
apply:

- QUIC flow control says how many bytes the transport currently accepts.
- A negotiated `lease` says how many application messages the server permits;
  `request-n` is still advisory and does not enlarge any byte limit.

An endpoint MUST bound complete message bytes that have been framed for this
lane but not yet accepted by the WebTransport send stream. That bound MUST be
at least **1,048,576 bytes per session**, and at least the largest record this
endpoint may itself emit (15.1) where out-of-band knowledge raised that above
the unnegotiated maximum - otherwise emitting a record the sender is permitted
to emit would force it to reset its own lane. The sum is over each queued
record's `messageLength`; the length prefix (at most 5 bytes, 15.1) and the
`kind` byte are fixed framing overhead and do not count. One maximum-size
message therefore always
fits. The endpoint MUST stop pulling or producing optional work while the
stream is blocked. If adding the next complete record would cross the bound, it resets the
reliable lane with `SLOW_CONSUMER`; it MUST NOT drop a reliable record,
silently skip a `seq`, or spill into a second stream. Recoverable topics then
resume on a new connection by section 15.5; non-recoverable topics re-snapshot
as section 7 already requires. The datagram lane may continue after the reset.

An inbound declared record above the receiver's 15.1 limit is stopped/reset with
`RECORD_TOO_LARGE`. A non-canonical/zero prefix, a prefix over 5 bytes, an
unknown `kind` (anything but `0x00`/`0x01`, 15.1), a text record that is not
valid UTF-8, an invalid registered binary shape, or FIN inside a record is
reset with `PROTOCOL_ERROR`. The two codes never overlap because the checks are
ordered: the prefix is decided first and COMPLETE (15.1), with structure before
size - a prefix over 5 bytes or not canonically encoded is `PROTOCOL_ERROR`
whatever length it would have denoted, and `RECORD_TOO_LARGE` applies only to a
well-formed length. Only a record that passed both prefix verdicts has its
`kind` byte and body judged at all, so a refused length is never also reported
for its `kind`. A receiver that judged a partial prefix value instead could
answer the same bytes with either code, which is why 15.1 forbids it. These errors
close the reliable lane and its state, not the whole WebTransport session.

One inner breach is deliberately NOT a lane reset: a CLIENT-TO-SERVER
control-shaped record that reaches section 1.2's 8192-byte ceiling is answered
with the ordinary `error` control frame and the lane stays open (15.1). That
ceiling does not apply server-to-client, so a large `batch` record is bounded
only by the record limit. Section 12's authorization and rate limits still
apply after deframing.

### 15.7 Conformance and coexistence

A client or server claiming the reliable-stream binding MUST implement Core
conformance from section 13 over this carriage, the framing/topology/lifecycle
rules of section 15, and every optional inner capability it advertises or
emits. Binary conformance continues to require JSON fallback. A datagram-only
implementation claims section 14, not section 15.

A session may therefore be:

- datagram-only (section 14 declarations and room membership);
- reliable-only (`lantean.reliable:1`, no implicit datagram room); or
- combined (one reliable stream plus the unchanged datagram lane).

Neither declaration implies the other. In particular the CONNECT
`game.fanout:1` token gates compact datagram fan-out only, while a
`game.fanout:1` token inside `hello.caps` gates compact fan-out on the reliable
lane in section 6.7's WebSocket form: the ordinary `wire-id` binding of section
6.2, announced before the first `0x03` frame for the topic, and NOT section
14.6's reserved id `0`. That reserved
id exists only because a datagram session holds exactly one CONNECT-bound room
(14.1), which is not true of the reliable lane. Nothing here is a special case:
15.1 carries the WebSocket message bytes unchanged, so the reliable lane carries
the WebSocket form of every capability.

## Appendix A. Annotated session transcript

One connection, from open to a binary frame to a reconnect gap-fill. `->` is
client-to-server, `<-` is server-to-client. This transcript doubles as an
eyeball-checkable test vector (machine-readable vectors: appendix F).

```
     (WebSocket opens)
<-   {"type":"welcome","sessionId":"7b1c0d2e-...-a90f"}
->   {"type":"hello","caps":["batch","smooth.protocol:1"]}
->   {"type":"subscribe","topic":"arena:1","ref":1}
<-   {"type":"subscribed","topic":"arena:1","ref":1,"epoch":1720094400000}
<-   {"topic":"arena:1","event":"state","data":{"tick":41},"seq":1}
<-   {"type":"wire-id","topic":"arena:1","id":4294967297}
<-   03 01 81 80 80 80 10 AC 02 AA BB CC
       |  |  \___________/  \___/ \______/
       |  |  topicId         seq   payload (opaque codec bytes)
       |  |  = 4294967297     = 300
       |  schemaVersion = 1
       0x03 binary tag

     (connection drops; client reconnects, gets a fresh welcome, re-hellos)
->   {"type":"subscribe","topic":"arena:1","ref":1,
      "recover":{"offset":300,"epoch":1720094400000}}
<-   (gap-fill for seq 301..now, as codec frames or __replay events)
<-   {"type":"subscribed","topic":"arena:1","ref":1,"epoch":1720094400000}
```

Reading the `0x03` frame byte by byte:

- `03` - binary tag.
- `01` - schema version 1.
- `81 80 80 80 10` - `topicId` varint. LEB128, least-significant byte first,
  continuation bit `0x80`: `0x01 + (0x00<<7) + (0x00<<14) + (0x00<<21) + (0x10<<28)`
  = `1 + (16 * 2^28)` = `4294967297`. This id is at or above 2^32 because
  `arena:1` is a shared-cohort topic (section 6.2) - a client decoding this with
  32-bit shifts would read the wrong number.
- `AC 02` - `seq` varint: `0x2C + (0x02<<7)` = `44 + 256` = `300`.
- `AA BB CC` - payload, opaque to the framework (the `smooth.protocol:1` codec's
  own bytes).

The epoch `1720094400000` is a wall-clock-ms generation stamp in the
single-process default; the client stores it verbatim and reports it back on
`recover`. Because the reconnect reported the same epoch, the server gap-fills
from seq 300 rather than cold-rehydrating.

## Appendix B. Sequence diagrams

### B.1 Binary negotiation (with JSON fallback)

```
Client                                  Server
  |                                        |
  |--- hello caps:[smooth.protocol:1] ---->|
  |--- subscribe arena:1 ----------------->|
  |<-- subscribed arena:1 (epoch) ---------|
  |                                        |
  |            [token known + backpressure OK]
  |<-- wire-id arena:1 -> id --------------|
  |<-- 0x03 [id][seq][payload] ------------|   (binary from here)
  |                                        |
  |            [token absent, OR a frame dropped -> poisoned]
  |<-- {topic:arena:1,event,data,seq} -----|   (JSON, permanently for this cap)
```

A client MUST accept the JSON envelope for `arena:1` at any time, even after
`0x03` frames, because the server can revert to JSON for the rest of the
connection (section 6.4).

### B.2 Resume

```
Client reconnects, re-subscribes with recover:{offset, epoch}
  |
  |  server compares reported epoch to the topic's current epoch
  |
  +-- epochs EQUAL ------> gap-fill seq (offset+1 .. now) --> subscribed
  |
  +-- epochs DIFFER -----> rehydrate {epoch} (no gap-fill) --> subscribed
  |                        (client re-snapshots the topic)
  |
  +-- buffer trimmed ----> truncated / end{truncated:true} --> subscribed
                           (client re-snapshots the topic)
```

## Appendix C. Registries

### C.1 Control-frame `type` registry

Framework-defined `type` values. An unrecognized `type` is passed through
(server: to the app handler; client: ignored) per section 1.4.

`welcome`, `hello`, `lease-ok`, `subscribe`, `subscribe-batch`, `unsubscribe`,
`subscribed`, `subscribe-denied`, `batch`, `request`, `reply`, `wire-id`,
`resume`, `resumed`, `lease`, `request-n`, `error`, `ingress-ok`,
`ingress-bind`, `ingress-bound`, `reconnect`, `game`, `game-denied`,
`message-overloaded`, and the
plugin frames of section 8 (`cursor`,
`cursor-snapshot`, `cursor-viewport`, `presence-update`, `presence-snapshot`,
`replay`).

### C.2 Reserved topic-prefix registry

Topics beginning `__` are framework-owned and client-subscribe is denied by
default (section 3.2.1). Known prefixes and their owning layer:

| Prefix | Layer |
|---|---|
| `__replay:` | Replay / resume gap-fill |
| `__presence:` | Presence roster |
| `__cursor:` | Cursor |
| `__crdt:` | CRDT updates |
| `__smooth:` / `__smoothcell:` | Smoothed-entity state and interest cells |
| `__group:` | Group membership |
| `__signal:` | Signalling |
| `__conn:` | Per-connection channel |
| `__subscriptions:` | Subscription bookkeeping |

The list is illustrative, not closed: the whole `__` namespace is reserved. An
application MUST NOT define its own `__`-prefixed topics.

### C.3 Binary leading-byte registry

| Byte | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0x00` | `svelte-realtime` binary RPC (client to server) |
| `0x01` | Upload chunk (`svelte-realtime`, client to server) |
| `0x02` | Upload cancel (`svelte-realtime`, client to server) |
| `0x03` | Topic payload (egress) / ingress payload (section 6) |
| `0x04`-`0xFF` | Reserved |

A Reserved value is not an open slot: it is assignable only behind a future
negotiated capability token (sections 5, 10), whether that token arrives in
this revision or a later one, so its meaning can never change for a peer that
did not opt in. Until such an assignment is negotiated on a connection, a
leading byte with no registered
meaning follows section 1.4 - client to server it reaches the application
message handler untouched, server to client the reference client drops it - so
untagged application binary is, and remains, legal on every connection that
has not negotiated a future assignment.

### C.4 Protocol `error` code registry

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `CONTROL_FRAME_TOO_LARGE` | A control-shaped frame exceeded the ceiling (sections 1.2, 3.7). |
| `RECOVER_REQUIRES_REF` | A `subscribe` asked for `recover` without a `ref` (sections 3.2, 3.7). |

### C.5 WebTransport CONNECT capability registry

The repeated query key is `lantean-cap` (section 14.7). Registered decoded
values are:

| Token | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `game.fanout:1` | Decode compact `game` fan-out datagrams (14.6). |
| `lantean.reliable:1` | Permit the reliable bidirectional stream (15). |

### C.6 WebTransport reliable-stream error registry

These are WebTransport application error codes carried by RESET_STREAM and/or
STOP_SENDING for section 15's stream. They close only the reliable lane unless
the transport itself also closes.

| Code | Name | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `0x01` | `STREAM_LIMIT` | A reserved, additional, wrong-direction, or undeclared stream was opened. |
| `0x02` | `RECORD_TOO_LARGE` | A decoded inner message length exceeded the receiver's own limit (15.1; deployment-configurable, 1 MiB absent configuration - a sender within the unnegotiated 1 MiB bound may still exceed a lowered limit, and refusing it is conforming). |
| `0x03` | `PROTOCOL_ERROR` | Record framing, body, or inner message was malformed: a bad prefix (including one over 5 bytes), an unknown `kind` byte, an invalid-UTF-8 text record, or a malformed inner message (15.1, 15.6). |
| `0x04` | `SLOW_CONSUMER` | Pending framed bytes would exceed this endpoint's own per-session bound (15.6; at least 1 MiB, and at least the largest record this endpoint may itself emit). |

## Appendix D. Design rationale (why the wire is shaped this way)

This appendix is the wire-specific decision record. The cross-package index
routes protocol evolution through
[Protocol compatibility](./docs/decisions/protocol-compatibility.md).

These non-choices are deliberate and are recorded so they are not relitigated:

- **No wire version number.** Capability tokens ARE the versioning. A monolithic
  protocol version forces a version matrix; independent per-feature tokens let a
  client and server negotiate one feature at a time and never desync on an
  unrelated change. The absence of a version field is a feature.
- **JSON default, binary opt-in.** A JSON-only client is complete and debuggable
  with no tooling. Binary is a per-capability optimization for hot paths, never a
  precondition for correctness.
- **Per-connection lazy topic ids.** No global id registry to coordinate,
  reconnect-safe, and an id is allocated only for a topic that actually sends
  binary to that connection.
- **Binary is server-to-client for topic payloads; client-to-server only for a
  negotiated ingress binding.** Fan-out is the dominant direction, so that is
  where the encoding lives; client input rides binary only when a hot path
  justifies the `wire.ingress:1` handshake.
- **Flow control is server-sized lease/grant, not client credit.** For a
  fan-out-dominant workload the server observes its own pressure and paces from
  there; per-stream client credit would over-engineer for a load shape that does
  not occur.
- **`j` is a de-herd window, not a server-rolled delay.** One frame fans out to
  many clients; a value the server pre-rolled would synchronize the herd it is
  meant to spread, so each client rolls its own delay in `[0, j)`.
- **Poison-to-JSON on a dropped binary frame** degrades one capability rather than
  desyncing a client dictionary or dropping the connection.
- **Epoch on resume.** A generation stamp per topic is what lets a resume survive
  a server restart or a shard move without silently serving stale sequence
  numbers - the failure mode most homegrown resume schemes hit.
- **`schemaVersion` rides every `0x03` frame** even though a connection's
  negotiated version is fixed at attach. The byte is what lets DIFFERENT tiers
  coexist on one topic and one connection - a per-connection dictionary encode
  and the shared baseline encode a degraded sibling receives carry different
  versions frame by frame - without re-announcing ids. One byte buys the whole
  degradation model of section 6.4.
- **Per-topic subscribe acks, even for a 256-topic batch.** Each `subscribed`
  ack is the ORDERING FENCE for its topic's resume gap-fill (section 11): the
  gap-fill precedes exactly that ack. One combined batch ack would have to wait
  for the slowest authorization gate and would leave gap-fill boundaries
  unmarked; N small acks are the price of per-topic resume that starts flowing
  immediately.
- **Acks exist only where the client must ACT.** `lease` gets `lease-ok`
  (start honouring windows), ingress gets `ingress-ok`/`ingress-bound` (start
  sending binary), but codec tokens get no acknowledgement: decoding is
  reactive, so there is nothing a client would do differently on a codec-token
  ack. `hello` therefore has no general ack, and an `ingress-bind` for a kind
  the server has not (yet) registered gets silence rather than a rejection -
  handlers register lazily, so "unknown" is routinely transient (section 3.8),
  and the JSON fallback is already correct while it lasts.
- **One ordered WebTransport stream, not one stream per topic.** The reliable
  protocol already promises one ordering domain per connection and uses
  control records as fences. Splitting it across QUIC streams would add
  cross-stream races for welcome, hello, wire-id, resume, and subscribe acks.
  One long-lived bidi stream preserves the WebSocket ordering model.
- **Length prefix and kind byte outside byte-identical inner messages.** A QUIC
  stream needs record boundaries; placing canonical varint length and the
  message type outside the message lets every schema, codec, vector, and
  fallback stay shared across transports. CONNECT capability gating makes the
  new carriage additive without reinterpreting reserved streams for old
  sessions.
- **The kind byte re-supplies the WebSocket opcode; nothing else could.** A
  WebSocket message carries a type the protocol observably routes on: the
  adapter surfaces `isBinary`, and section 1.4 delivers opaque client binary
  untouched, so an application binary payload may be byte-identical to a text
  message (arbitrary binary may begin `{` and be valid UTF-8). Without a
  discriminator those two distinct inputs become indistinguishable records, and
  first-byte demux cannot recover them. That is not only lost fidelity - it is type
  confusion: a peer could be steered into `JSON.parse` on attacker-controlled
  binary, or into handing text to a binary decode path, which is exactly the
  class of failure a framing layer exists to prevent. The byte is separate
  rather than folded into the varint's low bit because the fold makes the
  prefix stop being the length: every implementer carries a shift, one
  forgotten shift silently corrupts BOTH fields at once, error messages report
  doubled numbers, and the expressible length halves - all to save less than
  one byte amortised on a lane whose records are dominated by control frames
  and batches well past 100 bytes, while the 60 Hz traffic rides section 14
  datagrams. An unknown kind is rejected rather than passed through because the
  pass-through rule exists for frames a peer can safely ignore or forward; a
  record whose type is unknown can be delivered nowhere safely. A text record
  must be whole-record valid UTF-8 for RFC 6455 parity, so the carriage never
  accepts a text message the WebSocket carriage would have failed.
- **QUIC flow control does not replace leases.** QUIC limits bytes accepted by
  the transport; `lease` limits application messages according to server
  pressure. The finite pending-record bound - at least 1 MiB, and at least what
  this endpoint may itself emit - prevents either mechanism from becoming an
  unbounded userspace queue.
- **What a sender may emit is fixed; what a receiver accepts is its own.** A
  single fixed ceiling would have been simpler, but the inbound message limit is
  a documented deployment knob, so one fixed stream ceiling would make the same
  message legal on a deployment's WebSocket and refused on its stream. Making
  the whole bound configurable is worse still: nothing here negotiates a size,
  so a sender bound only by its peer's setting could never tell whether it is
  conformant. Splitting the two obligations gives each side a rule it can apply
  alone - the sender a constant it always satisfies, the receiver its own
  configuration - and leaves exceeding the constant to deployments that know
  both ends, which is the same standing the WebSocket carriage gives it. The
  5-byte prefix cap bounds the parse before any length is known.

## Appendix F. Companion artifacts

The [conformance index](./docs/protocol-conformance.md) is the task-oriented
entry point for these artifacts and their executable proofs. Three
machine-checkable artifact families live beside this document and are validated
in CI against the reference implementation, so the spec cannot drift from the
wire:

- **[`protocol.schema.json`](./protocol.schema.json)** - a JSON Schema for every control frame and the
  data-event envelope. A third-party implementer can validate captured frames
  against it.
- **[`test-vectors/`](./test-vectors/README.md)** - recorded transcripts (including a byte-exact `0x03`
  frame and a fragmented WebTransport reliable-stream transcript) a third-party
  implementer can replay to check a decoder.
- **`protocol.schema.json#x-webtransport`** - machine-readable CONNECT token,
  record-limit, topology, and stream-error constants for runtimes whose schema
  tooling ignores prose.

A [minimal dependency-free Core client](./examples/minimal-client.mjs) (~40
lines) implements connect, subscribe, data-event dispatch, and
resume-on-subscribe - the complete Core class (section 13) by construction. It
is exercised by the repository's
[minimal-client conformance test](https://github.com/lanteanio/svelte-adapter-uws/blob/dev/test/minimal-client.test.js)
against the reference server.
