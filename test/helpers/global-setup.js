// Build the fixture variants a run will actually use, ONCE, before any test
// file starts.
//
// Several suites boot the real built runtime, and each called `buildFixtureOnce`
// itself. That is correct - the on-disk lock makes it safe across vitest's
// worker processes - but it is not FAST or quiet: with several variants and
// workers starting together, N processes arrive at one lock at once, every loser
// sleep-polls for the duration of somebody else's `vite build`, and a suite
// whose own timer is running while it waits can trip on a slow machine. Two
// files failed that way in a full parallel run and passed in isolation, which is
// the worst shape a test failure can have - it reads as a real defect.
//
// Doing the builds here removes the contention entirely rather than tuning
// around it: by the time any suite calls `buildFixtureOnce`, the stamp matches
// and the call is a digest check. Suites keep their own call, so running a single
// file directly still works.
//
// SCOPED TO THE RUN. Building every variant unconditionally made
// `npx vitest run test/env.test.js` pay one serial `vite build` per variant on a cold tree
// before a single test executed, for a suite that boots no runtime at all. Since
// every suite still builds what it needs on demand, pre-building the wrong set
// costs only the contention this file exists to avoid - never correctness - so
// narrowing it by what the run selected is safe.
