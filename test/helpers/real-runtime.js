// WHY THIS EXISTS. src/testing.js and src/vite.js reimplement runtime
// behaviour by hand, so a suite that boots `createTestServer` proves nothing
// about src/runtime/**. That is not theoretical: security fixes have shipped
// with tests that looked end-to-end, passed, and stayed green when the fix was
// deleted, because the assertion never reached the code that was changed.
// Anything asserting a runtime security decision belongs here instead.
//
// WHAT MAKES AN ASSERTION COUNT. Assert on the frame the CLIENT receives, or on
// the bytes on the wire. A helper's return value, a source string, or a
// mock platform's recorded call can all stay true while the production wiring
// is dead.
//
// ONE VARIANT PER TEST FILE. The built handler is an ESM module imported into
// the vitest worker process, and it reads its env at module eval, so a second
// boot inside the same file gets the first module instance back. A file needing
// a different build-time config or a different env is a different file.
