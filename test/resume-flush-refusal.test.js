// The resume gap-fill flush kept pushing into a socket that was refusing every
// frame, and told the client nothing.
//
// uWS answers a send past maxBackpressure with the DROPPED sentinel (2). It does
// NOT throw, so a loop that only caught throws saw nothing wrong: a slow
// consumer resuming a large window crossed its limit partway through, every
// remaining frame was handed to a socket discarding it, each was charged to
// bytesOut on the next line as though delivered, and the client then received
// the `resumed` ack and went live believing it was caught up - with a hole in
// the middle it has no way to detect.
//
// The rest of this runtime already pattern-matches that sentinel (the wire lanes
// branch on `result === 2` and degrade), and the overflow branch directly above
// the flush already shows the answer for an uncoverable hole: emit the
// `__replay:<topic>` truncated marker so the client drops its stale offset and
// cold-resyncs. This pins the mid-flush refusal onto the same behaviour.
//
// Driven against the SHIPPED flushResumeTopic with a scripted socket, because a
// real socket cannot be asked to refuse on cue - the same reason the wire
// suites script connections rather than negotiate real backpressure.

/**
 * A socket that accepts `acceptCount` sends and then refuses everything, the
 * way uWS does once a connection is past maxBackpressure - and that INVALIDATES
 * ITSELF on end(), which is the half that matters here.
 *
 * uWS fires the close handler synchronously inside end(), and after that a
 * send() throws ('Invalid access of closed uWS.WebSocket') while
 * getUserData() keeps working - on that tick and on later ones. MEASURED
 * against the pinned v20.69.0 with the socket first buried past
 * maxBackpressure, which is the exact state the flush gives up in; an earlier
 * version of this file scripted every post-end access as throwing, which is
 * not what the native socket does. A scripted socket has to model the real
 * one in both directions: too permissive hides a real hazard, too strict
 * invents one and invites a fix for a problem that does not exist.
