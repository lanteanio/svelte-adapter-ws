// ADAPTER-ERR-TLS-SWAP and ADAPTER-ERR-TLS-WATCH, driven from the conditions
// they claim.
//
// TLS-SWAP's cause is a swap that failed partway through applying a new
// certificate set. The two partial shapes its consequence names are produced
// by applyServerNames: a host already moved to the new certificate (whose
// fresh SNI router is empty until the caller replays routes), and a host
// removed but not yet re-added (which falls back to the default context and
// the boot-time certificate). The cases drive the pure export with a
// recording app and real certificate files, and hold it to the contract the
// entry stands on: a mutation-phase throw is MARKED (tlsAppTouched), a
// validation throw leaves the app untouched, and an unchanged fingerprint is
// a no-op.
//
// TLS-WATCH's consequence promises the degraded state STAYS set: a dead
// directory watch cannot be resurrected by any later reload, so the
// arm-time catch-up swapping a renewal that was already on disk must not
// read as recovery. That decision lives in the degraded-state ledger, a
// pure export, driven here for every transition the two entries describe.
//
// The full serving behaviors behind the shapes - the mirrored router after a
// successful swap, the default-context fallback for unmatched SNI - are
// driven with real handshakes in test/tls-watch.test.js.
