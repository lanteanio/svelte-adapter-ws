// The ring is filled from the moment of spawn, but a worker drains only after
// module evaluation, its init hook and warmup. Bytes written before that just
// sit there, and the spill they build reads to the age ceiling - a STALL
// detector - as a worker that stopped draining: under sustained relay traffic
// the 5s ceiling quarantined the still-booting worker, whose respawn landed in
// the same window, converting one crash at relay peak into restart-limit
// exhaustion and a whole-process exit.
//
// Bounding that phase from inside the ring writer was tried first and is the
// wrong shape: the writer cannot tell a slow boot from a dead one, so any
// deadline it applied was either shorter than a legitimate init hook - the
// same respawn loop, just later - or too long to be worth having. The primary
// CAN tell, because the worker reports it. So the fan-out asks.
