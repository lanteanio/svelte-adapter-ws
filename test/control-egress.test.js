// The control/ack channel is an amplifier, and this is what bounds it.
//
// A client names a topic in a few bytes and is answered with a whole frame.
// Measured on this runtime at the worst legal shape: one 8,109-byte
// `subscribe-batch` of 1,344 shortest-legal topics comes back as 97,216 bytes
// across 1,344 frames - twelve times what it cost to ask, and repeatable,
// because the frame is legal and nothing refuses the next one.
//
// The defences that do not cover it: the 8 KiB control-frame limit bounds one
// frame rather than the rate; every `messageAdmission` limit is zero-by-default,
// so out of the box there is no inbound rate at all; the publish-egress ceilings
// bound application publishes and never see an ack; and `maxBackpressure` bounds
// the queue in MEMORY, which is why this is a CPU and bandwidth problem.
