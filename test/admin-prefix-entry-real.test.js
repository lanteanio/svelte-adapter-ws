// The reserved admin namespace is entered by RESOLUTION as well as by spelling.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The mirror of the escape this repo already refuses. The
// admin route is mounted on the raw prefix and uWS matches the raw target, so a
// target whose raw spelling sits OUTSIDE `/__realtime` but which RESOLVES
// inside it never reaches the admin lane at all: it falls through to the static
// and SSR lanes, and building the Web `Request` there resolves the dot segments
// and hands the app's own router a pathname inside the reserved namespace.
//
//   GET /foo/../__realtime/introspect
//     raw target       /foo/../__realtime/introspect   -> misses the mount
//     Request pathname /__realtime/introspect          -> inside the prefix
//
// The adapter documents the prefix as reserved and mounted ahead of page
// routing, and an app is entitled to read that as "my routes never see it".
// Whether it held was decided by the caller's spelling.
//
// The lane a request is served by is chosen from the RAW target, so a target
// that resolves into a lane its raw form did not choose describes itself as one
// request and is routed as another. That is refused, not rerouted, for the same
// reason the escape is: rerouting picks one of the two readings on the caller's
// behalf, and picking the prefix would let any caller reach the admin lane by a
// spelling a fronting proxy's ACL never recognizes as admin.
//
// WHAT MAKES THE ASSERTION COUNT. The fixture app has a real route inside the
// prefix (`src/routes/__realtime/[...rest]`), and it reports that it ran. So a
// failure here is the APP answering a reserved path, not a status code standing
// in for one - and the direct spelling in the first case proves the app route
// is shadowed when the reservation does hold.
//
// RAW SOCKETS, NOT fetch(). Every HTTP client resolves the target before it
// goes out, so `fetch('/foo/../__realtime/introspect')` puts
// `/__realtime/introspect` on the wire, matches the mount, and never exercises
// this at all.
//
// ONE VARIANT PER TEST FILE, for the reason given in helpers/real-runtime.js.
