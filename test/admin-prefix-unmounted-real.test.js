// Without the admin mount there is no reservation, so nothing is refused.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The main request edge refuses a target whose raw spelling is
// outside `/__realtime` and whose resolved form is inside it. What makes that
// refusal correct is the MOUNT: the admin route is what claims the prefix, and
// it is only registered when the app's WS handler exports `admin()`. An app
// without one owns the prefix like any other path - this fixture serves a real
// route there - and refusing the resolved spelling would take away a path the
// app is serving, for a lane that does not exist on this instance.
//
// Nothing else can fail if that condition is dropped: every suite that exercises
// the refusal boots a variant WITH an admin handler, so the check would still
// look right while quietly answering 400 for an app route. This is the case
// that fails instead.
//
// RAW SOCKETS, NOT fetch(). Every HTTP client resolves the target before it
// goes out, so the unresolved spelling never reaches the wire otherwise.
//
// ONE VARIANT PER TEST FILE, for the reason given in helpers/real-runtime.js.
