// The resume lane honours the server-grant model, against the REAL runtime.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The `resume` frame is CLIENT-NAMED: the client supplies the
// topics in `lastSeenSeqs`, and the app's resume hook typically answers each
// one with that topic's replay buffer. Under the pure-grant model every other
// client-named lane is gated - the wire subscribe, the subscribe-batch, and the
// presence/cursor observer lanes - but this one was not, which made it the
// LARGEST hole of the set: it yields a topic's message history rather than a
// roster.
//
// Reported from the extensions side, where the same asymmetry was found from
// the other direction. Ungated topics are filtered out before the hook sees
// them, rather than the whole frame being refused, because a reconnect names
// every topic the client held and a client legitimately holds some of them.
//
// ONE VARIANT PER TEST FILE, for the reason given in helpers/real-runtime.js.
