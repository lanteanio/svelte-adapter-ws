// The resume gap-fill flush giving up on a buried connection, driven end to end
// against the REAL built runtime with a real socket earning a real refusal.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The flush reads uWS's DROPPED sentinel and, when even the
// truncation marker is refused, closes the connection so the client reconnects
// and resumes from what it actually received. Nothing covered that path against
// a real socket: the unit suite beside this one scripts the refusal, which is
// the only way to refuse on cue, but a scripted socket proves only that the
// branch runs - not that a real uWS connection ever reaches it. Here the
// backpressure is real (a client that stops reading, against a 4 KiB
// maxBackpressure), so the whole chain is exercised: capture window, held
// frames, refusal partway, refused marker, close.
//
// WHAT IT ASSERTS, and why from two connections. The flushed client cannot
// report its own close: its close FRAME is queued behind the megabytes that
// caused the refusal, so it only ever observes an abnormal 1006. The server's
// close hook is where the real code is visible, and 1013 is reachable from
// nowhere else in this runtime - so a bystander reads it back, and that is the
// positive proof the give-up path ran. The bystander also answers before the
// spill as its own control, so a silent bystander cannot be mistaken for a probe
// that never worked, and it answers after as a standing guard that one buried
// consumer does not cost the worker.
//
// A NOTE ON WHAT THIS DOES NOT SHOW, because it was originally written to show
// it. The facade keeps `getUserData` working after `end()` by design (it hands
// back the stored userData unconditionally) and only throws on `send`, and both
// sites the subscribe lane
// touches afterwards - joinSharedCohort and sendSubscribed - already guard every
// socket call. So the post-close continuation is wasted bookkeeping and a
// misleading closed-socket abort, not a crash. The caller stops anyway because
// that is the honest answer; do not read this file as pinning a worker kill.
//
// ONE VARIANT PER TEST FILE, for the reason given in helpers/real-runtime.js.
