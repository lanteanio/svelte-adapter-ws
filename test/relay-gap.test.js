// [1,2,3] hold the same maximum and hash identically no matter how the entries
// are folded, so the relay can drop a frame to exactly one worker and nothing
// reports it. What distinguishes them is contiguity, tracked per (topic, origin)
// over the relay ORDINAL each sending worker stamps on its outbound frames.
//
// Unlike a maximum, a hole is decidable locally - the ordinal is dense at the
// origin by construction, so a worker holding 1 that receives 3 knows 2 was sent
// and never arrived. So these are REPORTS, not votes, and the tests below are
// about what a single worker concludes from its own delivery. The silence cases
// matter as much as the detections: a report can restart the worker, so a worker
// that lost nothing must say nothing, however it joined or whatever it missed
