// The per-topic sequence registry ceiling, against the REAL built runtime.
//
// `maxTopicSeqEntries` bounds two registries: the publish counters
// (`topicSeqs`) and the highest-observed map (`maxSeenSeq`). The unit suite in
// test/seq-bound.test.js drives the bound over plain maps, which proves the
// eviction mechanism and nothing about who calls it - and the defect this file
// exists to catch lived entirely in the callers: five publish lanes wrote
// `maxSeenSeq` directly, so the observed registry grew past the configured
// ceiling while the counter registry, and every model of it, stayed honest.
//
// So these assertions read the runtime's OWN registries after driving its own
// publish surfaces, at a four-entry ceiling baked into a dedicated fixture
// build. Nothing here is subscribed and no cross-worker reporter is running, so
// every candidate is evictable and the ceiling is exact: an over-cap reading is
// the bound failing, not the documented clustered overshoot.
