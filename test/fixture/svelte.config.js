// that proof vacuous: deleting the consolidated wiring would silently fall back
// to this sidecar, which computes the identical adapter with the identical out
// directory, and the canary would stay green while testing the legacy path.
//
// So this file DECLINES to configure the adapter for that variant. If the
// consolidated wiring is ever removed, the build falls through to adapter-auto
// and produces no runnable `build-consolidated/index.js` - which is exactly the
// failure a current `sv` user hits, and exactly what the canary must catch.
