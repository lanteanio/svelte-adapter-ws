// Presence wired the documented way, with the periodic full-roster heartbeat OFF.
//
// The heartbeat is what REPAIRS a dropped diff: it rebroadcasts the whole roster
// on an interval, so a delivery suite running against the default 30 s heartbeat
// can pass on the repair rather than on the frame it meant to assert. With it
// off, every roster change reaches a peer as exactly one diff or not at all,
// which is the property nothing else in the suite can see - presence publishes
// `{ seq: false }`, so a dropped diff carries no sequence gap, no retry and no
// detection of any kind.
//
// The constructor warns once per process that `heartbeat: 0` is half an opt-out
// whose other half is the client's `maxAge`. That warning is expected here and
// does not apply: these connections live for the length of one case, far inside
// any sweep window, and the suite asserts frames as they arrive rather than
// reading a decayed roster.

//
// Cursor keeps its SHIPPED coalescing (topicThrottle 16, i.e. a 60 Hz tick).
