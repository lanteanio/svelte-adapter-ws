// Fixture for the subscribe-batch authorization-ordering defect.
//
// This is the documented presence wiring - `export const { subscribe, ... } =
// presence.hooks` - with the wire-subscribe grant gate ARMED. Presence's
// subscribe hook is a side effect rather than a decision and is marked as such,
// so the gate stays armed. That combination is exactly what makes the ordering
// bug reachable: the batch path used to run the hook for every valid topic and
// only consult the grant decision at the landing, so the hook's side effects -
// joining the roster, establishing the `__presence:` observer tap - had already
// happened for a topic the caller was then told FORBIDDEN about.
//
// The roster is echoed back over the socket on request. A test that asserted
// only the ABSENCE of roster traffic would pass against a server that produces
// no traffic at all, so what is asserted is a positive reading of who the
// server believes is on the topic.
