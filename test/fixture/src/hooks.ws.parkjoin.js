// Fixture handler for the parked hook-INSTALLS-membership variant.
//
// The revocation-during-a-parked-hook shape, produced honestly: the client
// subscribes a group channel; the app's authorization wrapper PARKS; a
// server-side revocation
// (platform.unsubscribe) lands while it is parked; the wrapper then releases
// INTO the group join, and joining installs tracked membership for the very
// topic in flight (trackedSubscribe inside the plugin's subscribe hook). The
// landing therefore finds the topic HELD - and must still honor the
// tombstone: answer FORBIDDEN and unwind the membership the revoked attempt
// installed, rather than acking the held topic.
//
// The park is real for the same reason as hooks.ws.park.js: without a hook
// that genuinely suspends, every await in the landing resolves within one
// microtask and no client frame can interleave a revocation inside the
// begin/settle window the test exists for.
//
// The resolver lives on the CONNECTION (userData), not a module slot - see
// hooks.ws.park.js for why a module global strands earlier connections.
