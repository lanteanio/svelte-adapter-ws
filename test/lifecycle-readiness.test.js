// Readiness, draining and the shutdown budget, driven against the REAL runtime.
//
// The three states this file separates are the whole point of it: LIVE (the
// process is up), READY (a load balancer may route here) and ACCEPTING (the
// listen socket takes connections) are independent, and every defect these
// cases lock down came from two of them being answered by one flag - readiness
// green while `init` was still running, readiness green through the whole
// load-balancer drain delay, the shutdown timeout bounding only the phase the
// adapter controls.
//
// HOW EACH BLOCK IS DRIVEN, and why:
//   - the certificate-reload alert is pure, so it is driven directly;
//   - the lifecycle states are read off the BUILT runtime's own lifecycle
//     module while its routes answer over a real socket, so the state and what
//     a probe actually sees are asserted together;
//   - the shutdown sequence lives in the server entry (src/runtime/index.js),
//     which only runs as a process, so those cases spawn the built server and
//     drive it the way an orchestrator does.
//
// The spawned server is started through a small wrapper module: Windows does
// not deliver SIGTERM to a Node child (the runtime maps it onto an immediate
// TerminateProcess), so on that platform the wrapper re-emits the event on the
// child's own process object from a line on stdin. Everything downstream of
// that - the signal handler, the drain, the budget, the exit - is production
// code either way, and on POSIX the real signal is used.
