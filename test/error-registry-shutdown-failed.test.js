// ADAPTER-ERR-SHUTDOWN-FAILED, driven from the condition it claims against
// the built runtime as a real child process.
//
// Every application-supplied input to the graceful sequence is contained
// behind its own entry - a throwing ws shutdown hook (WS-SHUTDOWN-HOOK-THREW),
// a rejecting or throwing `sveltekit:shutdown` listener
// (SHUTDOWN-LISTENER-REJECTED / -THREW), a wedged one (-UNSETTLED), an
// overrunning drain (SHUTDOWN-REQUESTS-DROPPED) - so this entry is the last
// resort for the sequence's OWN machinery throwing. The realistic way an
// application reaches it is a broken global: instrumentation layers rewrap
// process and EventEmitter internals routinely, and a patch that throws when
// the cleanup step reads the listener list is exactly "the graceful shutdown
// sequence itself threw". The hookcrash fixture installs that patch behind an
// env-gated drill header and dispatches SIGTERM through the real handler.
//
// The entry's consequence has two halves and both are asserted: the orderly
// steps after the throw were skipped (the shutdown reports itself NOT clean),
// and the process STILL EXITS rather than hanging - which is the half that
// matters at 3am, and the half a case that only greps for the line would
// leave unproved.
