// TRACE and TRACK produced a generic 500 instead of 405.
//
// The cause was that the fetch specification forbids CONNECT, TRACE and TRACK,
// so `new Request()` throws a TypeError for them, and that throw reached the
// generic SSR failure path. Two consequences, and the second is the worse one:
// the status was wrong, AND every probe emitted a full error-severity
// diagnostic with a request id, so a scanner sending TRACE in a loop could fill
// an operator's error log with no application involvement at all.
//
// Driven over a raw socket rather than fetch, because fetch itself refuses to
// send these methods - they are forbidden on the client side too, so a test
// written with fetch cannot reach the server path at all.
