// `createTestServer` always accepted a registry as an INPUT and registered its
// own instruments against it. What it did not do was hand that registry back as
// `platform.metrics`, or answer `platform.metricsSnapshot()` - both of which
// exist only in the built production runtime. So the one route the README leads
// with, a `/metrics` endpoint reading `platform.metrics`, was the one route that
// could not be exercised anywhere but a production build: a test for it had to
// be written against a different surface than the code it was testing.
//
// These cases drive the harness platform the way an app route would.
