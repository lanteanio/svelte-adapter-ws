// publishWireBatch read the caller's entries again AFTER application code had
// already run inside the call.
//
// completeEnvelope runs JSON.stringify, so a payload's toJSON executes in the
// middle of the stamping loop while the batch is half-built. Everything read
// after that point - the exclusion target in the delivery walk, the payload the
// binary encode receives, the entry count - came back out of the caller's array,
// so one entry's toJSON could change what a LATER read of an EARLIER entry saw.
//
// Three consequences are observable from outside, and this file pins them
// against the real built runtime:
//   1. the JSON envelope and the binary frame carry different payloads under the
//      same seq, so two subscribers disagree about one sequenced frame;
//   2. an exclusion the caller set is dropped (or one the caller never set is
//      honoured), so the wrong sockets receive an entry;
//   3. the batch publishes an entry set the caller never committed - one grown
//      or shrunk from inside the call.
//
// LIMIT, deliberately not tested as a fix: mutating the payload object's own
// fields (rather than replacing the reference) still reaches the binary encode,
// because every path holds the same object by reference and deep-copying a
// payload on a per-message path is not a trade this adapter makes.
