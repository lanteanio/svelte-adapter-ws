// The relay re-entry marker is not something an application can reach.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. publishWire has an origin side and a relay side, and ONE
// boolean picks between them. The relay side skips the cluster sequence-
// authority check, skips the seq value check, skips the egress decision, skips
// the publish counter and the max-seen record, stamps the number it was handed
// instead of drawing the topic counter, and does not relay - all correct for a
// frame a sibling worker already published, counted and fanned out.
//
// That boolean was first read from two ordinary option keys, `_isRelay` and
// `_relaySeq`, on the same caller-supplied object every other publish option
// arrives on, so an application could set them and publish an arbitrary number
// as a topic's seq: off the publish ledger, past an armed egress ceiling, and
// out through the cluster relay the authority rule exists to keep unallocated
// numbers out of.
//
// Naming the key with a Symbol did not close it. A marker read as a PROPERTY is
// unspellable but not unforgeable: a caller never has to name the key, only to
// pass an object that answers for every key - `new Proxy({}, { get: () => x })`,
// or a getter inherited from a prototype - and it takes the relay arm without
// knowing what the key is called. So the marker is not a key at all now. It is
// an argument compared by identity against a token the module never hands out,
// and there is no property lookup left for such an object to answer.
//
// WHAT MAKES THESE CASES ABLE TO FAIL. The stamp is the observable projection
// of that one boolean: a frame carrying the topic counter's number took the
// ORIGIN arm, and every other guard sits on the same arm. So the forgery cases
// assert the seq the client received, and the ceiling case adds the one
// refusal a caller observes directly - a publish that answers false.
