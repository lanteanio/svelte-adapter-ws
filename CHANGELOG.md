## [Unreleased]

### Added

- The HTTP half: the `adapter()` build (rollup-bundled server output, the
  public `@sveltejs/kit/node` primitives bundled in as `server/kit-node.js`)
  and the `node:http`/`node:https` runtime. Static and prerendered assets are
  served from an in-memory index with negotiated precompressed
  representations, per-representation weak ETags, single byte ranges,
  If-None-Match/If-Range preconditions, the dotfile refusal with the
  `.well-known` carve-out, and the prerendered trailing-slash rules. SSR flows
  through `getRequest`/`setResponse` with concurrent-request dedup for
  anonymous GET/HEAD, single-chunk dynamic compression (skipped for
  credentialed requests as BREACH defense), a default
  `x-content-type-options: nosniff`, and a duplicate-header policy that
  refuses repeated singleton headers and keeps the last line of proxy identity
  headers. Health and readiness probes, readiness-gated SSR warmup,
  `ADDRESS_HEADER`/`TRUSTED_PROXIES` client-IP resolution, and graceful
  shutdown that drains in-flight requests. The `websocket` and `tracing`
  options, `PROXY_PROTOCOL=1` and `CLUSTER_WORKERS` refuse loudly instead of
  silently doing nothing.

- The repository, its conventions, and the API probe. `probe/ws-api-facts.mjs`
  measures every `node:http` and `ws` behavior the adapter design depends on -
  send results, backpressure and drain signals, closed-socket behavior, the
  upgrade flow, payload limits, compression negotiation, ping and idle
  handling, message buffer lifetime, prototype patchability, shutdown drain,
  listen options, and the availability of the public `@sveltejs/kit/node`
  primitives - and writes a committed report so a Node or `ws` upgrade that
  changes an observed behavior shows up as a diff. TLS is recorded as manual
  because it needs certs.

- `protocol.schema.json`, vendored byte-identical from svelte-adapter-uws and
  held that way by `.gitattributes`, so the wire this adapter speaks is the wire
  the lead adapter declares.

- The determinism ratchet (`npm run check:determinism`): every clock, RNG and
  timer read under `src/` must go through the injectable runtime module, or the
  scan fails naming the raw call site.

There is no adapter yet. The runtime, the test lanes and the published package
land in the slices listed under Current state in the README.
